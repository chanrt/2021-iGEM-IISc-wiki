                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    CellOPHane aims to tackle the burgeoning menace of organophosphate pollution, which has an adverse
                    impact on our ecosystem and the health of all living beings. The use of pesticides was introduced in
                    India during the 1960s, and these are today used on a large scale. Pesticides are a hallmark feature
                    of Indian agriculture. Since India's Green Revolution, the consumption of pesticides in India has
                    increased several hundred folds, from 154 MT (Metric Tonnes) in 1954 to 88,000 MT in 2000-2001.
                    According to the latest official reports (cite), the net consumption of chemical pesticides in India
                    amounts to 3,05,605 MT from 2016 to 2021. As much as 72.41% of the consumption is in seven states
                    (most of which are the "agricultural hotspots" of the nation), while all the other 21 states and 8
                    union territories contribute to only 27.59%.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Use of organophosphates as pesticides came about as an alternative to chlorinated hydrocarbons
                    due to their high degradability. Although these xenobiotics degrade under natural conditions, their
                    residues have been detected in soil, sediments, and water due to their non-regulated usage practice,
                    often at levels higher than their LD50 values. The over-reliance on pesticides has not only
                    threatened our environment, but contamination by organophosphate residues has been detected in many
                    agricultural products like tea, sugars, vegetables, and fruits throughout India. The Poison
                    Information Centre in National Institute of Occupational Health, Ahmedabad, reported that
                    organophosphates were responsible for the maximum cases of poisoning (73%) among all agricultural
                    pesticides in India. Although organophosphate toxicity has been exceedingly alarming in India,
                    mainstream media reporting of its impacts has remained surprisingly low.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Project CellOPHane was aimed at addressing this void in efforts to tackle organophosphate pollution
                    by creating a novel, modular and eco-friendly filter for the bioremediation of organophosphates.
                    Like most scientific ventures, the project is meaningful only in an appropriate social context.
                    Keeping this in mind throughout our project cycle, we have been focussed on engaging with all
                    possible stakeholders of the project to understand their perspectives and incorporate required
                    changes into our project both from technical and mechanistic angles. The foundations of a
                    well-planned and implementable iGEM project lie in a human-centred design. Team iGEM IISc-Bangalore
                    has tried to do just that - keep society at the heart of Project CellOPHane.

                <p>
                    To fully understand the problem and subsequently design a plan to address it, our team utilized a
                    human-centred design process enunciated by iGEM Calgary 2019, which leads to integration with key
                    stakeholders and end users throughout the project lifecycle. To do this, with each new idea, we
                    iteratively cycled through the HP pathway which involves the following steps:

                    Not only did we try to incorporate these broad themes into our project, but we also went about
                    categorizing each of them into concrete actionables, which collectively could serve as an HP
                    'toolkit' for all future iGEM teams. The inspiration for these specific 'actionables' came from
                    integrating the HP efforts put in by multiple iGEM teams in the past and adding the 'cherry on the
                    cake' with our own novelties.

                <h3>Step 1: Understand the Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    During brainstorming phase, our team started out by looking up the projects of previous iGEM teams.
                    One of the projects we came across was Aqualose, the project by Team iGEM Imperial College London
                    2014. Aqualose was aimed at designing a bacterial cellulose based filter to remove metal ions from
                    contaminated water. We started to think if we could utilize this concept in some novel way to solve
                    a local problem by creatively taking this idea to the next level and translating it to a simple,
                    cheap, scalable and affordable platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parallelly, some of us were also working at trying to understand the problems faced by the
                    agriculture sector in India, which is the main source of income to more than half our population.
                    Competing for the agriculture track was what we were looking at. We noted that while the tremendous
                    success of the Green Revolution in India has led to self-sufficiency in food production for the
                    country, it has had many long-term repercussions which are currently plaguing the fertile bowls of
                    the country. Meanwhile, the instructor for our humanities course shared a documentary with the class
                    about "<b>Cancer Express</b>". It is the infamous nickname of Passenger Express 339. The cancer
                    patients
                    from Malwa region of Punjab travel almost 326 km on it daily to reach Acharya Tulsi Regional Cancer
                    Treatment and Research Centre in Bikaner (in Rajasthan), the closest affordable government cancer
                    hospital. Malwa consumes 75% of the pesticides used in Punjab. The abundance of cancer cases has
                    been shown to bear some strong epidemiological correlation with heavy usage of organophosphates in
                    Malwa region and its leaching into the waterbodies. This unique niche at the interface of
                    agriculture and environment seemed most interesting to us, more so in our local context. While
                    "global problems, local solutions" has been a longstanding motto of an entire contingent of
                    scientific endeavours (which has been made somewhat cliché by overuse), we were inspired to reverse
                    it to <b>"local problems, global solutions"</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then undertook an extensive literature review to focus on the environmental impacts of
                    agriculture in India. Pesticide toxicity has been identified as one of the mammoth problems which
                    the Indian populace, particularly our rural populace, has been challenged with. Among the pesticides
                    used in India, reports indicated that organophosphates had been one of the most widely used classes
                    of pesticides in India. Furthermore, somewhat around this time, the Government of India also issued
                    a draft notification banning the usage of 27 pesticides all over the country, many of which were
                    highly toxic organophosphates (Class Ia of the WHO classification). However, there were other
                    extremely toxic organophosphates which had not been considered for the ban! Furthermore, all
                    searches for the final notification confirming this ban have been unsuccessful to this day!
                </p>
                <p>
                    These efforts led to us defining our problem - tackling organophosphate toxicity in water bodies.
                    Another critical aspect of our attempts to have a more complete understanding of the problem was
                    identifying stakeholders. To empathise with those affected and to benefit from multiplicity of
                    perspectives, it was essential to identify all possible stakeholders of the project. We not only
                    decided to identify the stakeholders at the outset, but to revisit our choice of stakeholders
                    repeatedly, throughout each of the stages of HP. We believe that every team should spend some time
                    to not only think about the stakeholders but also dynamically update their design at each and every
                    juncture of their HP journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this regard, we met <b>Dr. Bitasta Das</b>. She was the coordinator for the humanities courses of
                    undergraduate students at IISc. Dr. Das currently serves as Senior Editorial Assistant of the Office
                    of Communications, IISc. and has offered an NPTEL course titled "Artistic Exploration in Scientific
                    Research and Technology".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on our discussions with her, we identified the following stakeholders:

                <h3>Step 2: Ideate</h3>
                <p>
                    Next, we asked ourselves what we regard as one of the most fundamental questions for any team during
                    the iGEM cycle - <b>Is synthetic biology a good solution to our problem?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Literature reviews led us to other methods to combat organophosphate toxicity. We noted that they
                    either involved highly toxic reagents themselves or were impractical. It is impossible, for example,
                    to spray an insoluble powdery chemical over vast expanses of water bodies to precipitate the
                    dissolved organophosphates out of water!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started to brood over the possibility of using the concept used for Aqualose - a bacterial
                    cellulose based filter to combat organophosphate pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before designing our project, based on inputs from various stakeholders, we enlisted the
                    characteristics which our proposed solution should have:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cheap and affordable</li>
                    <li>Efficient</li>
                    <li>Not generate more pollutants</li>
                    <li>Biodegradable to the extent possible</li>
                    <li>Easy to use</li>
                    <li>Scalable</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div id="3" class="col s12" data-aos="fade-right">
                <h3>Step 3: Design a Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Keeping in mind Project Aqualose, we thought about using a bacterial cellulose based filter to
                    combat organophosphate pollution. Extensive reviews of scientific literature led us to a
                    cellulose-binding domain - dCBD and a broad-spectrum organophosphate hydrolase, OpdA. The kinetics
                    and various parameters for the enzyme had been well mapped. We decided to make a fusion protein by
                    combining the two domains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point we thought about one of the key considerations that our stakeholders had asked us to
                    keep in mind - cost and affordability. We had a discussion session with <b>Dr. Samay Pande, Prof.
                        Dipshikha Chakravortty, Prof. Utpal Nath and Dr. Sandeep M. Eswarappa</b>, who are faculty
                    members at
                    the Division of Biological Sciences, IISc. They reaffirmed the lingering question in our minds -
                    cost. In a country like India with a vast section of the rural populace living below poverty line,
                    many excellent scientific solutions do not simply translate to the society because of economic
                    inaccessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A cursory examination of the costs involved in various stages of protein production led us to
                    conclude that purification of proteins is one of the most expensive aspects of the process. Why not
                    make the fusion protein reusable, we asked?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then needed to identify the primary reason which would make the filter need to be replaced. After
                    going through available literature and talking to our friends from Materials Engineering
                    departments, we understood that the primary obstruction to this would be the We also focussed on
                    making reusability not a compromise on the quality of our product. Therefore, we were focussing on
                    two constructs - one carrying dCBD and one carrying OpdA. These two constructs were to be bound by
                    some interaction which can be annihilated easily without denaturing the protein. We could then have
                    the pure enzyme containing fraction. An enzymatic digestion of the cellulose sheet would then lead
                    to the dCBD containing fraction, which might be contaminated by other
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the interesting scientific developments in 2019 came to our rescue in this regard. We came
                    across a report of SpyTag-SpyCatcher system and the SpyTag-SpyDock system. SpyTag binds to
                    SpyCatcher via a covalent isopeptide bond and not SpyDock by a non-covalent bond. The affinity for
                    SpyTag with SpyDock is also very high and can be abrogated by elution with imidazole. This was
                    exactly what we needed! We therefore decided to pursue it further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having a rough idea in our minds, we decided to iterate through our process of identification of
                    stakeholders. To do this, we first decided to be more specific in our definitions of stakeholders
                    than our previous maiden attempt. This led to the following:
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    We then decided to first focus on the key players for our project. To first decide on whether the
                    solution proposed by us is feasible 'on paper', we decided to start by consultation with members of
                    the academia.

                        To fully understand the feasibility of application of SpyTag-SpyDock system in our project, we
                        contacted <b>Prof. Mark Howarth</b> from the University of Oxford, the developer of the
                        SpyTag-SpyDock
                        system. He put us in touch with <b>Dr. Anthony Keeble</b>, post-doctoral associate in his lab
                        who was
                        the lead author in reports of the Spy&Go system. We sought his suggestions about our project
                        implementation using SpyTag-SpyDock system. Dr. Keeble informed us of how shearing might cause
                        detachment of the SpyTagged enzyme from the sheet and cause rapid protein loss, thereby
                        requiring repeated functionalization of the sheet. Dr. Keeble suggested us to use SpyCatcher
                        instead and provided us insights into how modularity in our "plug-n-play" platform provides a
                        novel and feasible solution to the problem might indeed be, besides being a gamechanger for
                        bioremediation efforts. Dr. Keeble also informed us that while the kinetic data for the
                        interaction between SpyDock and SpyTag had been quantified, there had been no attempts to
                        realistically see how it responds to high velocity flows.

                        when subjected to shear by water flow. We decided therefore to fill this void by quantitatively
                        modelling the interaction and following its kinetics. This would help us to understand the
                        half-life of the SpyTag-SpyDock interaction, and thus make a more-informed choice for the DNA
                        parts which we wanted to use. Our <a class="content-link" href="Model.html">mathematical
                            model</a> indeed led to the
                        conclusion that even a very small rate of dissociation of SpyTag from SpyDock would cause a
                        rapid depletion of the SpyTag-SpyDock bound protein complex and a flushout of the SpyTagged
                        enzyme. Thus, the interaction with Dr. Keeble contributed to our modelling efforts and led to a
                        paradigm shift in our project idea (as described below).

                    <h4>Meeting Professor Padmanabhan Balaram </h4>
                    <p>
                        Once we were convinced about the unfeasibility of the usage of SpyDock, we decided to focus our
                        attention to creating a modular filter, which would herald the revolution in state-of-the-art
                        bioremediation strategies. Since our project required two fusion proteins, we sought the advice
                        of <b>Prof. P. Balaram</b>, the former Director of IISc and a retired professor of the Molecular
                        Biophysics Unit. Prof. Balaram's main area of research has been the investigation of the
                        structure, conformation, and biological activity of designed and natural peptides. He has been a
                        major contributor to the evaluation of factors influencing the folding and conformations of
                        designed peptides and has investigated structural elements playing a key role in the formation
                        of secondary structural motifs in proteins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team met Prof. Balaram virtually to discuss about rational design of linkers for our fusion
                        proteins. Based on our discussions with him, we could understand and appreciate the requirements
                        which the desired fusion proteins would have for a successful implementation of the project:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>They should not influence the structure of the functional protein domains</li>
                        <li>They should be flexible so as to allow ready access to the organophosphate substrates
                            flooding into the pipes of the filter</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        These inputs were of significant value to us, based on which we could try to design the linkers
                        appropriately. Furthermore, the issue of linker flexibility which Prof. Balaram mentioned to us
                        motivated us to pursue structural predictions of our proteins of interest - a new dimension to
                        our project that we have addressed under <a class="content-link"
                            href="Predictions.html">Structural Predictions of Proteins</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides focussing on the "key players" for our project based on the <a class="content-link"
                            href="#stake_five">stakeholder map</a> created by
                        us, we've also tried our best to focus on the
                        end-users of our device - the stakeholders who occupy the lower right quadrant of the
                        stakeholder map. We have tried to respectfully engage with those affected the most by the
                        enormity of this toxicity. We have surveyed farmers from multiple places in India to be aware of
                        their understanding of pesticide based pollution and organophosphate toxicity. Details of the
                        survey have been documented below.

                    sustain stakeholder interactions at all stages of the project and understand the ways in which we
                    could integrate their suggestions into our project. By engaging with other key players for our

                        He provided us with a fresh perspective on how we should design our project so that the
                        end-result may be a scalable, affordable, and effective device, and not just restricted to a
                        proof-of-concept (POC). He further gave us ideas on possible locations where a fully functioning
                        model of our design could be installed.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Runoff is a distributed source of pollution. In monsoon, distributed runoff can't be
                            channelized appropriately, and necessary residence time criteria might not be met. Thus, it
                            is
                            best to get a topological map of the region, identify large depressions where the runoff is
                            most
                            probable to collect and install our system there.</li>
                        <li>It is best to not use commercially available enzymes.</li>
                        <li>One should not be limited merely by the POC study. One must deliver science to the doorsteps
                            of common people. We should thus focus on devising an effective, scalable yet low-cost
                            solution.</li>

                    <p>
                        Our interaction with Prof. Ramachandra provided us newer ideas on designing the filter and
                        translating it to the real world. Based on his suggestions, we decided to try to design a

                    <h4>Meeting Mr. Amit Khurana</h4>
                    <p>
                        To understand the impact that organophosphates have had on society across India, we reached out
                        to <b>Dr. Sunita Narain</b>, the Director of the <b>Centre for Science and Environment
                            (CSE)</b>.
                        Centre for
                        Science and Environment (CSE) is a public interest research and advocacy organisation based in
                        New Delhi. CSE researches into, lobbies for and communicates the urgency of development that is

                    <p>
                        Dr. Narain connected us to <b>Mr. Amit Khurana</b>, the Program Director for Food Safety and
                        Toxins. In
                        a very illuminating conversation, Mr. Khurana talked to us about CSE's long-standing research on
                        the toxic effects of pesticides and their impact on the rural populace of India. From Mr.
                        Khurana, we learnt about the fact that the ban on some Class Ia organophosphates which we had
                        read about was a draft notification and had ultimately been withdrawn. Mr. Khurana was also kind
                        enough to share with us the reports of CSE's Pollution Monitoring Laboratory, an independent,
                        analytical laboratory that monitors toxic contamination of the environment and uses the results
                        of this monitoring to advocate for improved regulation of the use of toxins in the country.

                        <b>CSE's Pollution Monitoring Laboratory</b> had carried out Analysis of pesticide residues in
                        blood
                        samples from villages of Punjab in 2005. As discussed previously, Punjab was the "Ground Zero"
                        of India's Green Revolution. PML scientists visited Punjab and collected blood samples from 20
                        randomly selected people from 4 different villages of Punjab - Mahi Nangal, Jajjal and Balloh in
                        Bhatinda district and Dher in Ropar district. Among fourteen oragnophosphate pesticides analysed
                        in whole blood samples four were commonly detected - monocrotophos, chlorpyrifos, malathion and
                        phosphamidon. Monocrotophos was detected in 75% of the whole blood samples analysed from Punjab
                        villages at mean levels of 0.0948 mg/L , with the highest detected level being 0.4915 mg/L.
                        Similarly, chlorpyrifos was detected in 85% of the samples, while malathion and phosphamidon was
                        detected in 70% of the samples.

                    <p>
                        Mr. Khurana made us aware of the policy aspects of our project. He suggested us to think about
                        the threshold concentration of organophosphates which must be present in a sample of water so
                        that there is a detectable reduction in toxin load. He also asked us to think about the
                        potential application of our filter at the household level for obtaining clean drinking water.

                    <p>
                        The meeting with Mr. Khurana helped us understand about the dimensions of our project at the
                        science-society-policy interface. It inspired us to try to model the minimum detectable
                        concentration of pesticides which our filter would be able to reduce at a detectable level (say
                        > 80%). His wholesome evaluation of our project also affirmed the impact of the problem we had
                        chosen to tackle and made us surer about our objectives and goals.

                        for details), Dr. Chatterjee suggested us to delete sfGFP as GFP has been shown to adversely
                        impact the solubility of proteins in some cases. He also suggested us to perform assays with
                        whole cell lysate before proceeding to purification. This suggestion was of great help to us as
                        the whole cell lysate performed by us confirmed that some functional enzyme was really being
                        produced and the bottleneck was being caused by issues concerning the protein solubility and
                        stability.

                    <p>
                        On examining our experimental protocols, Prof. Varadarajan suggested us to delete the strongly
                        hydrophobic signal sequence of OpdA from our construct. Reviewing corresponding scientific
                        literature also pointed out the fact that the signal sequence was in fact deleted in cases where
                        the protein had been isolated for crystallography. Based on his suggestion, we decided to model
                        these fusion proteins using AlphaFold and investigate if there were issues with protein folding
                        caused by the signal peptide. The structural predictions indeed confirmed this hypothesis. The
                        signal peptide was found to be an IDR (intrinsically disordered region), which are known to be
                        causes of protein aggregation and concomitant degradation in multiple cases. We integrated Prof.
                        Varadarajan's suggestion by deleting the signal sequence and creating C2 (3.0), whose structural
                        predictions were significantly satisfying. We are currently working on using C2 (3.0) for our
                        filter.

                        In the meantime, as regards the production of bacterial cellulose, we contacted <b>Dr. Mudrika
                            Khandelwal</b> (Associate Professor, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, IIT
                        Hyderabad). She
                        has extensively worked on bacterial cellulose, its properties and manipulating it for
                        multifarious applications. Dr. Khandelwal connected us to <b>Dr. Shivakalyani Adepu</b> from her
                        group,
                        who gave us suggestions to optimise out protocol for bacterial cellulose sheet production. With
                        her help and advice, we managed to figure out the relevant loopholes in the protocols used by us
                        and decide the right set of conditions to suit our needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, in early October, we met <b>Prof. Mohan Balasubramaniam</b>, a Professor at the
                        Warwick
                        Medical School of the University of Warwick. Prof. Balasubramaniam had come to IISc as a visitor
                        in the lab of Dr. Palani. We presented our project to Prof. Balasubramaniam. He expressed his
                        delight at the usage of synthetic biology in our project to address fundamental problems
                        plaguing the health of the people in our local community. Furthermore, he suggested us to check
                        for protein expression in cell-free systems in order to bypass issues associated with
                        intracellular protein degradation. We are currently in the process of repeating our experiments
                        with cell-free systems side-by-side with intracellular expression of C2 (3.0).

                    <h4>Integrating advice for suitable implementation strategies </h4>
                    <p>
                        Based on our interaction with Prof. T.V. Ramachandra, we decided to not be limited at the
                        proof-of-concept stage but take our project beyond that. We therefore decided to try to design a
                        hardware prototype for our filter. For this, we contacted <b>Prof. Saptarshi Basu</b>. He is a
                        professor at the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering of IISc, and specialises in multiphase systems,
                        microfluidics, and biofuels. We explained our project to Prof. Basu in a virtual interaction
                        with him. He brought a fresh pulse of wind to our project owing to his completely different
                        background as compared to the rest of us. This multidisciplinary understanding made it easier
                        for us to model our project appropriately. In further interactions with him and his graduate
                        student <b>Mr. Omkar Hegde</b>, we figured out that we would need micrometre-bore channels for
                        our
                        purpose instead of the conventionally used millimetre-sized channels. This is because in systems
                        like ours with a very high flux rate (high Reynolds number system), if we were to use a
                        millimetre-sized channel, there would be insufficient mixing of the bulk of the fluid and hence
                        the OPs in the interior of the fluid channel would not encounter the enzymes coating the walls
                        of the channel.

                        We also met <b>Dr. Rajani Kanth Vangala</b> in this regard. Dr. Vangala has more than 15 years
                        of
                        experience as scientist, entrepreneur, social worker and facilitator. His passion is to work
                        with students and develop technologies in genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, bioinformatics
                        and engineering. He is currently the CEO of Neuome Technologies, aiming to develop healthcare
                        solutions through integrative scientific technologies. Dr. Vangala explained to us the various
                        stages through which a prototype must pass before being released to the market - Alpha, Beta and
                        Gamma. He took us through the various stages of prototype design. In his opinion, scalability
                        would not be problematic for our project once we were sure about the various components and
                        design. Dr. Vangala advised us on the funding necessary for the execution of various stages of
                        the project and the scientific milestones for every step. Our interaction with him illuminated
                        us about the steps needed to take our product from the bench to the bedside, and helped us plan
                        the road ahead.

                    <h4>Visit to Bangalore Bioinnovation Centre</h4>
                    <p>
                        While we have largely focussed on civil society activists and academia for our stakeholder
                        interactions, we have been careful enough to also lend an ear to the end-users - the farmers.
                        Furthermore, we have also been mindful to engage in a dialogue with the biotech entrepreneurial
                        ecosystem. The strong biotech and synthetic biology-based product delivery ecosystem in and
                        around Bengaluru was conducive to us for these interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this regard, we visited the Bangalore Bioinnovation Centre, which is a is a joint initiative
                        of Department of Biotechnology, Government of India and Department of Electronics, IT, BT and
                        S&T, Government of Karnataka. It works closely with Karnataka Innovation & Technology Society
                        (KITS), a nodal centre for implementing schemes of the Department of Electronics, IT, BT and
                        S&T, Government of Karnataka & its startup cell. It is a state-of-the-art translational research
                        and entrepreneurship centre catering to all the needs of start-ups in life science.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We interacted with Mr. Malathesh, a Junior Scientific Officer at the Centre and Dr. Veeranna, a
                        Senior Scientific Officer at the same place. During our interactions with them, the following
                        points came up:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The idea is readily applicable only to the hilly areas, where the farmers generally have
                            pressure of creating a proper drainage system. In Karnataka, the farming culture is mostly
                            different. Here the farmers let the soil soak in the water of field.</li>
                        <li>We need to create the hardware so that it's easy to customise the module depending on the
                            local
                            agricultural practice, in a commercial scale.</li>
                        <li>We could add a cheap and affordable water recycling module to our filter in order to reduce
                            the
                            headache of agriculturalists in drought-stricken areas.</li>
                        <li>This device should be most successful in domestic application. Moreover, the success in
                            domestic
                            application can give us an edge to get in a good position to propose the idea for larger
                            implementation. Hence, we should try to make the limit of detection of our filter
                            sufficiently
                            low to detect the organophosphate concentration in household water supply.</li>
                        <li>Work on additional pre-filtration, temperature control and pH control module right within
                            the
                            device, to increase its optimum life period.</li>

                        These interactions with the staff and scientific officers at Bangalore Bioinnovation Centre
                        provided us new insights about the scalability of the project. We integrated these suggestions
                        into refining our model of the limits of detection for our filter. Furthermore, we decided to
                        work on optimising the various filter parameters for our device like pH and temperature, based
                        on the stability of the proteins and the strength of the intermolecular interactions which form
                        the citadel of our filter design. The work is still under progress and we hope to have some
                        quantitative data on this soon.

                <h2>Evaluation of our project's core values and closing the loop</h2>
                <p>
                    Communicating with our stakeholders helped us identify and prioritise the main values we needed to
                    incorporate into our solution. These values, from highest priority to lowest priority, defined our
                    solution as one that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(1) produce detectable reduction of organophosphate load at reduced concentration</li>

                    <li>(2) involves respectfully engaging with those impacted</li>

                    <li>(3) is safe for surrounding ecosystems and people</li>

                    <li>(4) is easy to use</li>

                    <li>(5) is financially viable, affordable and scalable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In order to close the loop and make sure our solution aligns with stakeholder needs, we made sure to
                    evaluate our project in light of these values at each step of its development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To align with the most prioritised value, we have undertaken extensive literature review in our
                    choice of parts and constructs, and have tried to construct mathematical models for the same. We
                    have also engaged with the ones most impacted by this burgeoning pollution, who would be the
                    end-users of our product. We have made sure that the method advocated by us is as safe as possible
                    for surrounding environment by taking care of biodegradability of the filter base (bacterial
                    cellulose sheet) and addressing relevant biosafety concerns. Our filter prototype aims ultimately to
                    be easy to use, by requiring the users to do nothing but fit it at an appropriate location. The
                    remainder of the filter is successfully blackboxed. We are also in the process of contacting the
                    relevant experts in economic analyses to perform an exhaustive cost-benefit analysis of our project
                    to ensure affordability and scalability.

                    We have tried to adapt the human-centred project design to the extent as possible. In doing so, we

                    These actionable have been our experiences while progressing through the HP journey. Since there can
                    be no specific tailor made way to go about HP, this is bound to vary from team to team. We would
                    urge future teams to make modifications to this list and feel free to adapt these to their own
                    projects. An immensely useful tool in this regard can be the <a class="content-link"

                    This
                    would indeed help in achieving the "waterfall model of project development"

                    In general, a SynBio project has five primary dimensions - Public, Education, Industry, Entrepreneur
                    and Meetup (with stakeholders). Team iGEM IISc-Bangalore has sought to touch upon all these five
                    aspects of our project.

                    We began our IHP journey with an exploration into the complex and dynamic relationship between
                    people and science. To our team, combatting organophosphate toxicity provided the perfect nexus
                    between science and society. We wanted to make a difference in the lives of people in the community
                    around us and give back to the society. This disconnect was one which was characterised by an
                    underlying degree of public fear surrounding interventions by synthetic biology and genetic
                    engineering. Therefore, it was important in our project that we took action to close the loop
                    between this obvious disconnect between science and society. It was one of our project's aims to
                    encourage bilateral conversations, in the spirit of real and meaningful scientific and social
                    collaboration. This is the symbiosis between science and society that we aspired to achieve. We have
                    not only undertaken a dialogue with all stakeholders, but with the general public at large and tried
                    to further the interests of the SynBio community by producing quality educational resource
                    materials. Our project has shown us the power of <a class="content-link"
                        href="Communication.html">science communication and education</a> in closing the loop between
                    science and society. Through our human-centred
                    project design, we have come to the conclusion that a SynBio project at the science-society
                    interface can impact the lives of the affected positively and might be a step forward to change the
                    public perception about SynBio.
