                    As for the implementation, our team had to envision CellOPHane on the real world, making sure to
                    make a safe feasible device. We have integrated expert advice and our own considerations in our
                    process. Our work is founded on concepts of an efficient user interface and clever device design. A
                    rigorous study of who could be benefited the most from the device was performed. However, we
                    recognize that challenges still exist that needs to be solved for our hardware prototype.

                    From the very beginning of our iGEM journey, we planned for CellOPHane to be a real product, useful
                    in real life. We realise that, at this point, we are still too far from the actual practical
                    implementation of our device, but we have quite a precise idea of how it will all function together.

                <p>
                    Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes have a pore size of 0.1 to 0.01μm (i.e. 10 to 100nm) and are capable
                    of removing particulates, bacteria and viruses. Interestingly, bacterial cellulose (BC) sheets
                    naturally have pore sizes in this range. <b>Current ultrafiltration cannot remove small molecule
                        contaminants such as pesticides. While nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes can exclude
                        these small molecules, they are expensive and energy intensive to
                        use</b>. Flow rates are low, they require very high pressures and the input water must be
                    already
                    purified by primary as well as secondary processes to avoid damaging the membranes. UF processes are
                    currently limited by the <b>high cost of synthetic membranes</b>. Inevitable membrane fouling means
                    they
                    must be regularly replaced. Their use is also restricted by limitations in removal of small molecule
                    contaminants. They can only be employed where feed water is free of these contaminants or in tandem
                    with other (often slow or energy intensive) treatment methods for removing them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Microbial cellulose membranes are considerably cheaper than competitors. Whilst polyvinylidene
                    fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes cost as much as about $100 / m<sup>2</sup>, current BC
                    production for
                    nata de coco costs around $1.6 / g. Existing literature and the work of iGEM Imperial 2014 suggest
                    that BC is a durable material. However, we expect a shorter membrane life compared to the highly
                    durable PVDF. Being considerably cheaper and easier to dispose of, BC membranes could be more
                    regularly replaced and still provide a more cost effective solution. This would also save on
                    chemical washes regularly required to sustain the extended life of PVDF membranes.

                    People closely associated with farmland and agriculture are expected to derive a direct benefit from
                    CellOPHane. This group includes farmers, pesticide vendors, people living near croplands, soil
                    scientists, and administration to name a few. However, if we think deeply, each and every person in
                    the society would potentially be benefitted from our implementation, given the OP pollution is such
                    rampant and with devastating consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CellOPHane vows to save everyone from the wrath of organophosphate insecticides by providing access
                    to clean, OP-free water. We believe CellOPHane to not only be effective but also friendly to nature
                    and biodiversity. Therefore, it could be used in natural reserves, natural aquaparks, water tanks or
                    other water bodies where maintaining water quality, as well as biodiversity, is a priority.

                <h2>Implementing CellOPHane in the Real World</h2>
                <p>
                    We imagine the final product to be filter blocks or filter units. Each unit would consist of
                    multiple millimetre radius cylindrical PDMS channels whose inner surface is coated with
                    functionalized BC filter material. Optimizing the number per unit, arrangement, dimension, shape,
                    length, and area of cross-section of the channels would require a lot of further studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have thought of <b>two alternative modalities</b> to run the filtration process
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The first one utilizes a frequency generator in order to reap the benefits of capillary action
                        in purifying OP-contaminated water. It requires low energy input and is potentially portable.
                        However, it might be less practical as it is very difficult to collect a significant portion of
                        agricultural runoff in a reservoir.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To address the same, we can depend on the second modality: Using a pump to pass agricultural
                        runoff through the array of channels. This method is energy intensive but brings some added
                        advantages. The filter units can be installed side by side (i.e. in parallel) as often as
                        desired to increase the (input) flow rates. By connecting several filter units in
                        series, the degree of degradation of the organophosphate molecules could be uplifted. Thus, this
                        method allows for a high degree of flexibility, for a perfect adaptation to the conditions on
                        site, and makes a scale-up easy.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    As of now, we are clueless about the optimal modality our hardware should adopt. We will do further
                    work in this direction to find out the same.

                <h2>Safety and Security</h2>
                <p>
                    Proper safety rules are not only critical for the sake of our conscience but are also defined by
                    law. Since we were working with genetically modified organisms (GMOs), safety was very important
                    throughout our project. It was necessary to work consciously and safe, to ensure that neither the
                    environment nor humans are harmed. may not get outside of the lab. We needed to take precautions to
                    prevent our genetically modified E. coli from escaping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like project development, project implementation also involves plenty of safety aspects. These make
                    our approach applicable almost everywhere where organophosphate pesticides get into water:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Our hardware prototype is completely cell-free. The only place where we use living chassis is
                        during bioproduction of the individual hardware components. After BC overproduction, one must
                        subject the BC pellicles to alkaline wash to kill the attached bacteria (i.e. <em>K.
                            xylinus</em> or <em>A.
                            tumefaciens)</em>. We have used our chassis (i.e. E. coli) only as an expression host, as we
                        intend
                        to purify and use the proteins of interest produced by it. Using chassis as merely an expression
                        host avoids contamination of the environment with the chassis itself. By using immobilized
                        enzymes, we are <b>not dependent on living, expressing organisms on site</b>, thus avoiding the
                        regulations for genetically modified organisms (GMO).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From the very beginning the most important point in our project was environmental protection.
                        The degradation products of a typical organophosphate are a phosphodiester and a phenol
                        derivative. It is proven that these <b>degradation products pose a lower risk</b> to ecosystem
                        than the
                        substrates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Organophosphate pollution is of great concern not only in India but also all over the world.
                        Thus, it was essential for us to fight this problem with an <b>environmentally friendly</b>
                        method
                        since most existing methods to OP bioremediation are ecologically harmful and not functionally
                        adequate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The water flowing through the device can slough off the coat of functionalized filter with time.
                        However, it poses no harm to the environment as both bacterial cellulose and proteins are
                        <b>biodegradable</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PDMS tubes can cause microplastics pollution if they undergo oxidation, mechanical disturbance,
                        exposure to chemicals. However, the <b>risk of microplastics pollution</b> is low from the
                        proposed
                        device as the array of channels are to be placed inside a box (ideally closed system) and the
                        channels cannot come into contact with water due to the coating of functionalized filter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Even if we go by the frequency generator modality, the <b>risk of injury owing to the moving
                            parts
                            is negligible</b>. On the other hand, there is risk of electrocution in the water pump
                        modality.
                        However, mishaps can be kept at bay by <b>proper maintenance</b> of electrical junctions, wire
                        insulation, fuse, and earthing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trace amount of OP can linger on to BC substratum without getting degraded. As the functional
                        filter layer gets worn out with time, need would arise to take the device away from filtration
                        site, to take the channels out, to get rid off the remnants of old filter, and then to apply new
                        coating via dip coating. After taking the channels out, one must <b></b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dip coating process involves <b>organic solvents</b> which are harmful to health and
                        inflammable. These
                        must be disposed off with care.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Beyond the studies that can help determine the technical aspects of our desired prototype, it
                        must undergo a <b>comprehensive trial phase</b> before it is released for real-life usage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the device is installed, the functioning has to be <b>monitored meticulously</b>. A complementary

                <p>
                    The implementation of a synthetic biology project comes with multifaceted challenges. These hurdles
                    must be overcome in order to come up with an efficient device.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Ensuring the safety and security</b> aspects of our project is one of the major challenges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We are also aware of the <b>controversy and fear surrounding GMOs</b> in the eyes of the general
                        public
                        and it might present a great challenge for the implementation of our project. We believe that
                        this is often caused by misinformation or manipulation of the general public. Therefore, we take
                        it as our personal goal to disseminate accurate, rational and easily digestible information
                        about synthetic biology and educate as many people as possible about OP pollution. This has been
                        reflected in our Public Education and Engagement activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The biggest challenge is the <b>effectiveness of CellOPHane against high concentration of
                            organophosphate</b> pesticides in agricultural runoff. It would be best to use the filter
                        device at
                        the earliest possible stage of runoff treatment. However, it has not been possible for us to
                        test to what extent our device can mitigate OP pollution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Considering the <b>financial burden of launching our product</b>, the launch could be
                        potentially done
                        through aid of our sponsors and our institute. Locating grants and potential investors is going
                        to be another challenge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <b>hardware</b> part presents the biggest obstacle to the realization of our project.
                        Although we
                        have quite detailed plans, all aspects need to be considered again and planned and modelled
                        carefully so the final product will work flawlessly and effectively. Also, as we realised during
                        our stay at the lab, the practical realisation of one's ideas can be much more complicated than
                        first assumed. Therefore, it might take a long time to implement CellOPHane in the real world.
                        Nevertheless, we are working towards this goal with passion.

                <p>
                    Several months were spent on CellOPHane, and throughout the journey we identified and visualized how
                    other people could use our project and the science behind it to make something useful for various
                    target groups.

                <p>
                    With our project, we hope to draw the attention of future research teams to the topic of water
                    cleanliness as well as mitigation of agricultural hazards. Utilizing our plug-n-play filter
                    platform, other research groups in future would come up with their own bioremediation tool against
                    pollutions other than that caused by OP. We sincerely hope for their system as well as design to be
                    more sophisticated compared to ours as it stands now. Our work - comprising of engineering, wet lab,
                    dry lab, and human practices - might serve as inspiration to them.
