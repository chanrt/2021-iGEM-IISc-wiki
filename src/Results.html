                    For the functionalization aspect of our project, we have two constructs - C1 (SpyCatcher002-dCBD)
                    and C2 (OpdA-SpyTag002). This section mentions our efforts in order to produce, purify and
                    characterize these fusion proteins. We first cloned these modules in a suitable vector, carried out
                    some expression tests where we standardized the induction conditions, and then performed some
                    solubility tests as well, in order to check if these novel fusion proteins could be purified. We
                    were successful in figuring out suitable conditions for expression and purification of one of our
                    constructs, while it currently is a work-in-progress for the other construct.

                    Constructs C1 (SpyCatcher002-dCBD) and C2 (OpdA-SpyTag002) were synthesized by GenScript and shipped
                    to
                    us after being cloned into pUC57-Kan vectors. We amplified the constructs using suitable primers in
                    order to carry out Gibson assembly, by performing PCR with KOD polymerase. Gel electrophoresis
                    results

                    In order to express our constructs in <em></em>E. coli</em>, we chose a pETMCN-T7 (KanR) vector,
                    because it has a
                    high
                    copy number and transcription using the T7 RNA polymerase can be strongly induced upon addition of
                    IPTG.
                </p>
                <p>
                    pETMCN-T7 was linearized by digestion with NdeI. PCR primers for amplification of C1 and C2 were
                    designed to have overlaps with pETMCN-T7 on either side of the NdeI site. Both the PCR amplified
                    constructs and the linearized vector were gel extracted. Gibson Assembly was performed on these
                    samples
                    to yield C1_pETMCN-T7 and C2_pETMCN-T7.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The above samples were transformed into <em>E. coli</em> DH5 \(\alpha\), inoculated into liquid
                    culture,
                    and
                    miniprepped.
                    Double digestion was performed using NheI and BglII to verify positive clones by insert release. Gel
                    electrophoresis results are given below:

                    Amounts of protein loaded were not normalized, and hence large blobs were observed in the pellet
                    fractions. The bead-bound fraction for C1 showed a large band at ~25kDa, which implied that C1 was
                    appreciably soluble. No such observation could be made for C2.

                    was indeed soluble. To verify the same for C2, two Western blots were performed on the C2 pulldown

                    In the anti-GFP blot, a prominent band at ~75kDa could be observed, but there were a lot of other
                    bands
                    too, and similar lower molecular weight bands were observed for the anti-His blot too. This
                    suggested
                    that there was a lot of non-specific antibody binding, contamination, or protein degradation in case
                    of
                    C2. This was repeated for more dilute antibody treatments, but results looked similar, which led us
                    to
                    believe that C2 was indeed getting degraded.

                    To test whether it was possible to form a mechanically strong film of bacterial cellulose from
                    the
                    solutions in these solvents, we decided to perform a standard test used by materials engineers
                    for

                    glass

                    variety of treatment conditions. The film formed on the glass slide is observed.

                    Next, we sought to see if the addition of a binder like PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) could influence
                    the
                    mechanical integrity of the film and strengthen it. We tried to carry out drop-castings using
                    the
                    same solutions, but with 10 % w/v PVA added to it. Since quenching gave better results
                    previously,
                    all the samples were quenched on a pool of acetone after heating to evaporate the solvent.
                    Temperatures for heating were same as before. However, we found that all the drop-casted films
                    were
                    patchy and flaky and had turned brownish, except for the solution containing DMSO as solvent,
                    which
                    formed a homogenous sheet, albeit with a brownish hue.

                <p>
                    Having been slightly surprised at these results, we were intrigued to find out the possible
                    cause(s)
                    behind this. PVA is known to be strongly preferring the formation of mechanically strong films.
                    The
                    results therefore seem counter-intuitive at the first glance. However, a survey of existing
                    literature and the materials data sheets provided by companies led us to conclude that the
                    heating
                    regime used for most of the samples had exceeded the degradation temperature of PVA, while the
                    heating temperature for DMSO was slightly lower than the average degradation temperature. The
                    brownish colour was most likely imparted due to the influence of the degradation products of
                    PVA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We therefore decided to redo our experiment for PVA by using a lower temperature. Although this
                    would prolong the heating duration, we expected to see a stable film being formed, devoid of the
                    brownish hue of the previous case. Our hypothesis was indeed validated in the next experiment
                </p>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Solution</td>
                        <td>Heating</td>

                        <td>Heated on Hot Plate gradually till 90&deg;C for 8.5 min and then rapidly quenched</td>
                        <td>Homogenous sheet</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    We have thus tried to optimise the conditions for making MCC sheet from commercially available
                    powder. Further studies need to be done by drop-casting on a block of PDMS or inside a PDMS tube
                    instead of a glass slide. Detailed studies need to also be performed on the interesting solvent
                    system of 7% LiCl in DMAc, because the film formed in this case absorbs moisture due to the
                    presence
                    of hygroscopic LiCl and spontaneously gets healed of any cracks present.
