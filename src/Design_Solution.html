                <h3>Step 3: Design a Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Keeping in mind Project Aqualose, we thought about using a bacterial cellulose based filter to
                    combat organophosphate pollution. Extensive reviews of scientific literature led us to a
                    cellulose-binding domain - dCBD and a broad-spectrum organophosphate hydrolase, OpdA. The kinetics
                    and various parameters for the enzyme had been well mapped. We decided to make a fusion protein by
                    combining the two domains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point we thought about one of the key considerations that our stakeholders had asked us to
                    keep in mind - cost and affordability. We had a discussion session with <b>Dr. Samay Pande, Prof.
                        Dipshikha Chakravortty, Prof. Utpal Nath and Dr. Sandeep M. Eswarappa</b>, who are faculty
                    members at
                    the Division of Biological Sciences, IISc. They reaffirmed the lingering question in our minds -
                    cost. In a country like India with a vast section of the rural populace living below poverty line,
                    many excellent scientific solutions do not simply translate to the society because of economic
                    inaccessibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A cursory examination of the costs involved in various stages of protein production led us to
                    conclude that purification of proteins is one of the most expensive aspects of the process. Why not
                    make the fusion protein reusable, we asked?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then needed to identify the primary reason which would make the filter need to be replaced. After
                    going through available literature and talking to our friends from Materials Engineering
                    departments, we understood that the primary obstruction to this would be the We also focussed on
                    making reusability not a compromise on the quality of our product. Therefore, we were focussing on
                    two constructs - one carrying dCBD and one carrying OpdA. These two constructs were to be bound by
                    some interaction which can be annihilated easily without denaturing the protein. We could then have
                    the pure enzyme containing fraction. An enzymatic digestion of the cellulose sheet would then lead
                    to the dCBD containing fraction, which might be contaminated by other
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the interesting scientific developments in 2019 came to our rescue in this regard. We came
                    across a report of SpyTag-SpyCatcher system and the SpyTag-SpyDock system. SpyTag binds to
                    SpyCatcher via a covalent isopeptide bond and not SpyDock by a non-covalent bond. The affinity for
                    SpyTag with SpyDock is also very high and can be abrogated by elution with imidazole. This was
                    exactly what we needed! We therefore decided to pursue it further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having a rough idea in our minds, we decided to iterate through our process of identification of
                    stakeholders. To do this, we first decided to be more specific in our definitions of stakeholders
                    than our previous maiden attempt. This led to the following:
                </p>
                <div class="col s12" id="stake-five">
                    <center>
                        <img style="width: 80% !important;" class="responsive-img"
                            src="assets/images/IHP/stake_five.png">
                    </center>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To systematically achieve this objective, we made the stakeholder map after taking help from the
                    <a class="content-link" href="https://live.flatland.agency/12290417/rathenau-igem/">iGEMer's Guide
                        to the Future</a>. After thinking about the possible social influences of
                    the stakeholders mentioned before, we categorized the stakeholders using the following stakeholder
                    map:
                </p>
                <center>
                    <img class="responsive-img" src="assets/images/IHP/stakeholders_map.png">
                </center>
                <p>
                    We then decided to first focus on the key players for our project. To first decide on whether the
                    solution proposed by us is feasible 'on paper', we decided to start by consultation with members of
                    the academia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the background work we did in that context and the summaries of our interaction
                    with stakeholders:

                    <p>
                        To fully understand the feasibility of application of SpyTag-SpyDock system in our project, we
                        contacted <b>Prof. Mark Howarth</b> from the University of Oxford, the developer of the
                        SpyTag-SpyDock
                        system. He put us in touch with <b>Dr. Anthony Keeble</b>, post-doctoral associate in his lab
                        who was
                        the lead author in reports of the Spy&Go system. We sought his suggestions about our project
                        implementation using SpyTag-SpyDock system. Dr. Keeble informed us of how shearing might cause
                        detachment of the SpyTagged enzyme from the sheet and cause rapid protein loss, thereby
                        requiring repeated functionalization of the sheet. Dr. Keeble suggested us to use SpyCatcher
                        instead and provided us insights into how modularity in our "plug-n-play" platform provides a
                        novel and feasible solution to the problem might indeed be, besides being a gamechanger for
                        bioremediation efforts. Dr. Keeble also informed us that while the kinetic data for the
                        interaction between SpyDock and SpyTag had been quantified, there had been no attempts to
                        realistically see how it responds to high velocity flows.

                        No data was available then in literature about the half-life of the SpyTag-SpyDock interaction
                        when subjected to shear by water flow. We decided therefore to fill this void by quantitatively
                        modelling the interaction and following its kinetics. This would help us to understand the
                        half-life of the SpyTag-SpyDock interaction, and thus make a more-informed choice for the DNA
                        parts which we wanted to use. Our <a class="content-link" href="Model.html">mathematical
                            model</a> indeed led to the
                        conclusion that even a very small rate of dissociation of SpyTag from SpyDock would cause a
                        rapid depletion of the SpyTag-SpyDock bound protein complex and a flushout of the SpyTagged
                        enzyme. Thus, the interaction with Dr. Keeble contributed to our modelling efforts and led to a
                        paradigm shift in our project idea (as described below).

                    <h4>Meeting Professor Padmanabhan Balaram </h4>
                    <p>
                        Once we were convinced about the unfeasibility of the usage of SpyDock, we decided to focus our
                        attention to creating a modular filter, which would herald the revolution in state-of-the-art
                        bioremediation strategies. Since our project required two fusion proteins, we sought the advice
                        of <b>Prof. P. Balaram</b>, the former Director of IISc and a retired professor of the Molecular
                        Biophysics Unit. Prof. Balaram's main area of research has been the investigation of the
                        structure, conformation, and biological activity of designed and natural peptides. He has been a
                        major contributor to the evaluation of factors influencing the folding and conformations of
                        designed peptides and has investigated structural elements playing a key role in the formation
                        of secondary structural motifs in proteins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team met Prof. Balaram virtually to discuss about rational design of linkers for our fusion
                        proteins. Based on our discussions with him, we could understand and appreciate the requirements
                        which the desired fusion proteins would have for a successful implementation of the project:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>They should not influence the structure of the functional protein domains</li>
                        <li>They should be flexible so as to allow ready access to the organophosphate substrates
                            flooding into the pipes of the filter</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        These inputs were of significant value to us, based on which we could try to design the linkers
                        appropriately. Furthermore, the issue of linker flexibility which Prof. Balaram mentioned to us
                        motivated us to pursue structural predictions of our proteins of interest - a new dimension to
                        our project that we have addressed under <a class="content-link"
                            href="Predictions.html">Structural Predictions of Proteins</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides focussing on the "key players" for our project based on the <a class="content-link"
                            href="#stake_five">stakeholder map</a> created by
                        us, we've also tried our best to focus on the
                        end-users of our device - the stakeholders who occupy the lower right quadrant of the
                        stakeholder map. We have tried to respectfully engage with those affected the most by the
                        enormity of this toxicity. We have surveyed farmers from multiple places in India to be aware of
                        their understanding of pesticide based pollution and organophosphate toxicity. Details of the
                        survey have been documented below.
