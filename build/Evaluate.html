                    It is important not just to take stakeholders into confidence while designing a solution but also to
                    sustain stakeholder interactions at all stages of the project and understand the ways in which we
                    could integrate their suggestions into our project. By engaging with other key players for our
                    project, we could get our project evaluated through their lens and appreciate the various dimensions
                    that our project could potentially have. The stakeholders whom we met in this regard are enlisted

                    <h4>Meeting Prof. T V Ramachandra </h4>
                    <p>
                        Prof. T V Ramachandra is a professor at the Centre of Ecological Sciences at IISc. At present,
                        he is the Coordinator of Energy and Wetlands Research Group (EWRG) and the Convener of
                        Environmental Information System (ENVIS) at Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES). During the
                        past fifteen years he has established an active school of research in the area of energy and
                        environment. He was a Member of Karnataka State level Environment Expert Appraisal Committee
                        (2007-2010), appointed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India and a
                        member of Western Ghats task force appointed by the Government of Karnataka. TVR's research
                        interests are in the area of energy systems, renewable energy, energy conservation, energy
                        planning, aquatic ecosystems, biodiversity, EIA, valuation of ecosystems, environment auditing,
                        ecological modelling, geoinformatics, urban planning, carbon footprint and environmental
                        engineering education research.

                    <p>
                        He provided us with a fresh perspective on how we should design our project so that the
                        end-result may be a scalable, affordable, and effective device, and not just restricted to a
                        proof-of-concept (POC). He further gave us ideas on possible locations where a fully functioning
                        model of our design could be installed.

                        Some key points of our discussion with him are enumerated below:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Runoff is a distributed source of pollution. In monsoon, distributed runoff can't be
                            channelized appropriately, and necessary residence time criteria might not be met. Thus, it
                            is
                            best to get a topological map of the region, identify large depressions where the runoff is
                            most
                            probable to collect and install our system there.</li>
                        <li>It is best to not use commercially available enzymes.</li>
                        <li>One should not be limited merely by the POC study. One must deliver science to the doorsteps
                            of common people. We should thus focus on devising an effective, scalable yet low-cost
                            solution.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Our interaction with Prof. Ramachandra provided us newer ideas on designing the filter and
                        translating it to the real world. Based on his suggestions, we decided to try to design a
                        prototype of the filter. Further details on our attempts at prototype designing have been
                        enlisted <a class="content-link" href="#implementation">below</a>.

                        Dr. Narain connected us to <b>Mr. Amit Khurana</b>, the Program Director for Food Safety and
                        Toxins. In
                        a very illuminating conversation, Mr. Khurana talked to us about CSE's long-standing research on
                        the toxic effects of pesticides and their impact on the rural populace of India. From Mr.
                        Khurana, we learnt about the fact that the ban on some Class Ia organophosphates which we had
                        read about was a draft notification and had ultimately been withdrawn. Mr. Khurana was also kind
                        enough to share with us the reports of CSE's Pollution Monitoring Laboratory, an independent,
                        analytical laboratory that monitors toxic contamination of the environment and uses the results
                        of this monitoring to advocate for improved regulation of the use of toxins in the country.

                        <b>CSE's Pollution Monitoring Laboratory</b> had carried out Analysis of pesticide residues in
                        blood
                        samples from villages of Punjab in 2005. As discussed previously, Punjab was the "Ground Zero"
                        of India's Green Revolution. PML scientists visited Punjab and collected blood samples from 20
                        randomly selected people from 4 different villages of Punjab - Mahi Nangal, Jajjal and Balloh in
                        Bhatinda district and Dher in Ropar district. Among fourteen oragnophosphate pesticides analysed
                        in whole blood samples four were commonly detected - monocrotophos, chlorpyrifos, malathion and
                        phosphamidon. Monocrotophos was detected in 75% of the whole blood samples analysed from Punjab
                        villages at mean levels of 0.0948 mg/L , with the highest detected level being 0.4915 mg/L.
                        Similarly, chlorpyrifos was detected in 85% of the samples, while malathion and phosphamidon was
                        detected in 70% of the samples.

                        The report also notes that mean levels of total organochlorines in whole blood samples from
                        Punjab were 0.1424 mg/L while total organophosphorus was 0.2278 mg/L. Furthermore, the CSE PML's
                        report notes that "<b>Major contribution to total pesticide concentration in blood samples from

                        Mr. Khurana made us aware of the policy aspects of our project. He suggested us to think about
                        the threshold concentration of organophosphates which must be present in a sample of water so
                        that there is a detectable reduction in toxin load. He also asked us to think about the
                        potential application of our filter at the household level for obtaining clean drinking water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The meeting with Mr. Khurana helped us understand about the dimensions of our project at the
                        science-society-policy interface. It inspired us to try to model the minimum detectable
                        concentration of pesticides which our filter would be able to reduce at a detectable level (say
                        &gt; 80%). His wholesome evaluation of our project also affirmed the impact of the problem we had
                        chosen to tackle and made us surer about our objectives and goals.

                    <p>
                        Once we decided on our project and a rough plan for the constructs, we integrated the advice of
                        umpteen number of experts for different aspects of our project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We contacted <b>Dr. Saravanan Palani</b> for suggestions on fusion protein design. Dr. Palani is
                        an
                        expert in synthetic cell biology, and had joined the Dept. Of Biochemistry of IISc a few months
                        back when we approached in. He gave us necessary inputs on how to keep the protein domains
                        separate and how we could design our experiments to appropriately address the problem at hand.
                        Given his enormous expertise in designing fusion proteins, we requested Dr. Palani to be a
                        mentor for our team, a proposal to which he kindly consented.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, we then met <b>Prof. D.N. Rao</b>, a Professor Emeritus at the Dept. of
                        Biochemistry of
                        IISc. Prof. Rao has been a protein biochemist all through his life. His lab studies DNA-protein
                        interactions in various model systems. We approached Prof. Rao for his inputs. He suggested us
                        to focus on how we could design assays to validate our claims experimentally, at least on a
                        proof-of-concept level. Prof. Rao also put us in touch with <b>Prof. Dayanand Siddavattam</b> of
                        the
                        School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad. Prof. Dayanand has worked extensively on
                        phosphotriesterases (PTEs) and provided us inputs on designing assays. We focussed on creating
                        an assay which is cheap and simple to execute. Spectrophotometric assays were therefore chosen
                        for our project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides them, we have also sought the help of <b>Dr. Jayanta Chatterjee</b> (Associate
                        Professor,
                        Molecular Biophysics Unit, IISc) and <b>Prof. Raghavan Varadarajan</b> (Professor, Molecular
                        Biophysics
                        Unit, IISc). Both of them are structural biologists by practice, working on peptides and
                        proteins. On hearing about the bottleneck in our project regarding C2 (see Results [insert link]
                        for details), Dr. Chatterjee suggested us to delete sfGFP as GFP has been shown to adversely
                        impact the solubility of proteins in some cases. He also suggested us to perform assays with
                        whole cell lysate before proceeding to purification. This suggestion was of great help to us as
                        the whole cell lysate performed by us confirmed that some functional enzyme was really being
                        produced and the bottleneck was being caused by issues concerning the protein solubility and
                        stability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On examining our experimental protocols, Prof. Varadarajan suggested us to delete the strongly
                        hydrophobic signal sequence of OpdA from our construct. Reviewing corresponding scientific
                        literature also pointed out the fact that the signal sequence was in fact deleted in cases where
                        the protein had been isolated for crystallography. Based on his suggestion, we decided to model
                        these fusion proteins using AlphaFold and investigate if there were issues with protein folding
                        caused by the signal peptide. The structural predictions indeed confirmed this hypothesis. The
                        signal peptide was found to be an IDR (intrinsically disordered region), which are known to be
                        causes of protein aggregation and concomitant degradation in multiple cases. We integrated Prof.
                        Varadarajan's suggestion by deleting the signal sequence and creating C2 (3.0), whose structural
                        predictions were significantly satisfying. We are currently working on using C2 (3.0) for our
                        filter.

                        In the meantime, as regards the production of bacterial cellulose, we contacted <b>Dr. Mudrika
                            Khandelwal</b> (Associate Professor, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, IIT
                        Hyderabad). She
                        has extensively worked on bacterial cellulose, its properties and manipulating it for
                        multifarious applications. Dr. Khandelwal connected us to <b>Dr. Shivakalyani Adepu</b> from her
                        group,
                        who gave us suggestions to optimise out protocol for bacterial cellulose sheet production. With
                        her help and advice, we managed to figure out the relevant loopholes in the protocols used by us
                        and decide the right set of conditions to suit our needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, in early October, we met <b>Prof. Mohan Balasubramaniam</b>, a Professor at the
                        Warwick
                        Medical School of the University of Warwick. Prof. Balasubramaniam had come to IISc as a visitor
                        in the lab of Dr. Palani. We presented our project to Prof. Balasubramaniam. He expressed his
                        delight at the usage of synthetic biology in our project to address fundamental problems
                        plaguing the health of the people in our local community. Furthermore, he suggested us to check
                        for protein expression in cell-free systems in order to bypass issues associated with
                        intracellular protein degradation. We are currently in the process of repeating our experiments
                        with cell-free systems side-by-side with intracellular expression of C2 (3.0).

                    <p>
                        Based on our interaction with Prof. T.V. Ramachandra, we decided to not be limited at the
                        proof-of-concept stage but take our project beyond that. We therefore decided to try to design a
                        hardware prototype for our filter. For this, we contacted <b>Prof. Saptarshi Basu</b>. He is a
                        professor at the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering of IISc, and specialises in multiphase systems,
                        microfluidics, and biofuels. We explained our project to Prof. Basu in a virtual interaction
                        with him. He brought a fresh pulse of wind to our project owing to his completely different
                        background as compared to the rest of us. This multidisciplinary understanding made it easier
                        for us to model our project appropriately. In further interactions with him and his graduate
                        student <b>Mr. Omkar Hegde</b>, we figured out that we would need micrometre-bore channels for
                        our
                        purpose instead of the conventionally used millimetre-sized channels. This is because in systems
                        like ours with a very high flux rate (high Reynolds number system), if we were to use a
                        millimetre-sized channel, there would be insufficient mixing of the bulk of the fluid and hence
                        the OPs in the interior of the fluid channel would not encounter the enzymes coating the walls
                        of the channel.

                        We also met <b>Dr. Rajani Kanth Vangala</b> in this regard. Dr. Vangala has more than 15 years
                        of
                        experience as scientist, entrepreneur, social worker and facilitator. His passion is to work
                        with students and develop technologies in genomics, proteomics, nanotechnology, bioinformatics
                        and engineering. He is currently the CEO of Neuome Technologies, aiming to develop healthcare
                        solutions through integrative scientific technologies. Dr. Vangala explained to us the various
                        stages through which a prototype must pass before being released to the market - Alpha, Beta and
                        Gamma. He took us through the various stages of prototype design. In his opinion, scalability
                        would not be problematic for our project once we were sure about the various components and
                        design. Dr. Vangala advised us on the funding necessary for the execution of various stages of
                        the project and the scientific milestones for every step. Our interaction with him illuminated
                        us about the steps needed to take our product from the bench to the bedside, and helped us plan
                        the road ahead.

                        While we have largely focussed on civil society activists and academia for our stakeholder
                        interactions, we have been careful enough to also lend an ear to the end-users - the farmers.
                        Furthermore, we have also been mindful to engage in a dialogue with the biotech entrepreneurial

                        S&amp;T, Government of Karnataka. It works closely with Karnataka Innovation &amp; Technology Society
                        (KITS), a nodal centre for implementing schemes of the Department of Electronics, IT, BT and
                        S&amp;T, Government of Karnataka &amp; its startup cell. It is a state-of-the-art translational research
                        and entrepreneurship centre catering to all the needs of start-ups in life science.

                    <p>
                        We interacted with Mr. Malathesh, a Junior Scientific Officer at the Centre and Dr. Veeranna, a
                        Senior Scientific Officer at the same place. During our interactions with them, the following
                        points came up:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The idea is readily applicable only to the hilly areas, where the farmers generally have
                            pressure of creating a proper drainage system. In Karnataka, the farming culture is mostly
                            different. Here the farmers let the soil soak in the water of field.</li>
                        <li>We need to create the hardware so that it's easy to customise the module depending on the
                            local
                            agricultural practice, in a commercial scale.</li>
                        <li>We could add a cheap and affordable water recycling module to our filter in order to reduce
                            the
                            headache of agriculturalists in drought-stricken areas.</li>
                        <li>This device should be most successful in domestic application. Moreover, the success in
                            domestic
                            application can give us an edge to get in a good position to propose the idea for larger
                            implementation. Hence, we should try to make the limit of detection of our filter
                            sufficiently
                            low to detect the organophosphate concentration in household water supply.</li>
                        <li>Work on additional pre-filtration, temperature control and pH control module right within
                            the
                            device, to increase its optimum life period.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        These interactions with the staff and scientific officers at Bangalore Bioinnovation Centre
                        provided us new insights about the scalability of the project. We integrated these suggestions
                        into refining our model of the limits of detection for our filter. Furthermore, we decided to
                        work on optimising the various filter parameters for our device like pH and temperature, based
                        on the stability of the proteins and the strength of the intermolecular interactions which form
                        the citadel of our filter design. The work is still under progress and we hope to have some
                        quantitative data on this soon.
