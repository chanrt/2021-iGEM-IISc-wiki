                    The very first question every iGEM team needs to answer is what their project should be about. Our
                    goal was not only to participate successfully in the iGEM competition but to give something back to
                    both the synthetic biology community and our local community. Organophosphate (OP) pollution is a
                    major issue not only in India but also all over the globe. This inspired us to focus on the
                    degradation of organophosphates by implementation of synthetic biology. Our approach does not
                    suggest that OP pollution should continue, but it offers an environmentally friendly way to fight
                    the existing OP-polluted water.

                <p>
                    The proteins with which we intend to functionalize the bacterial cellulose (BC) filter should meet
                    three functional aspects:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It must attach to the BC substratum strongly enough that it does not get washed away with
                            the flow of water
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It must catalytically degrade harmful organophosphate molecules into relatively harmless
                            chemicals which can be easily separated from the water sample (say, with help of some
                            physical process).
                        </p>

                            It must be modular so that other teams in future can design some other bioremediation
                            process (for example, addressing organochlorine pollution) simply by doing a minor change to
                            our filtering platform.

                    These criteria were enough to convince us on designing fusion proteins in order to achieve our goal.
                    Our endeavours yielded blueprints of two fusion proteins, namely C1 and C2.

                            helps the protein to get exported to the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria (often
                            used in genetic engineering) via Sec translocation pathway. After aiding in secretion, the
                            signal is removed by a signal peptidase present in the periplasm.

                            The signal peptide is followed by 10x-Histidine (10x-His) tag which can later be used to
                            extract (as well as purify) the protein using lighter transition metal-based affinity
                            columns. The 10x-His tag was chosen instead of the traditional 6x-His tag as the former
                            conveys increased binding affinity for Ni resin and higher extent of purification compared
                            to the latter

                            The 10x-His tag is followed by SpyCatcher002. SpyCatcher002 is separated from 10x-His tag by
                            the GS Linker 1 so that these two do not interfere with each other's function.

                            SpyCatcher002 is followed by dCBD. These two are separated by GS Linker 2 (reason same as
                            previous instance). dCBD or double cellulose binding domain is a fusion of 2 different CBDs
                            of cellobiohydrolases found in <em>Trichoderma reesei</em>. It was chosen as its binding to
                            microcrystalline cellulose is synergistic. Thus, its binding efficiency to cellulose is much
                            higher than single (typical) CBDs. Also, binding is relatively unaltered by changes in time
                            and temperature. The two CBDs are denoted as CBHII CBD and CBHI CBD. dCBD comes with linker
                            between CBHI CBD and CBHII CBD, so we did not have to add any extra linker sequence with it.

                            The N-terminal features the organophosphate hydrolase OpdA along with its signal peptide
                            (i.e. <em>opdA</em> leader sequence). OpdA is a phosphotriesterase from <em>Agrobacterium
                                radiobacter</em>
                            P230 with broad substrate range (e.g. coumaphos, coroxon, parathion, diazinon, dMUP etc.).
                            We noticed in literature that the specificity constant of OpdA is much higher than that of
                            OPH (a well-studied and similar enzyme from <em>Pseudomonas diminuta</em>), in context of
                            parathion-methyl degradation. As mentioned in the "Background" page, parathion-methyl was
                            the second most consumed OP insecticide used over the 2005-2010 period in India and it
                            belongs to the most dreaded Class Ia! Thus, OpdA was chosen instead of the more popular
                            counterpart OPH.

                            SpyTag002 follows OpdA, followed by a 22 amino acid-long linker. Instead of designing
                            OpdA-SpyCatcher002 fusion and SpyTag002-dCBD fusion, we have gone for OpdA- SpyTag002 and
                            SpyCatcher002-dCBD. SpyTag002 is much shorter than SpyCatcher002, and thus the former is
                            less likely to interfere with the activity of OpdA than the latter.

                            SpyTag002 is followed by a short GS linker, and then a superfolder green fluorescent protein
                            (i.e. sfGFP). It is a basic (i.e. constitutively fluorescent) GFP derived from <em>Aequorea

                            It was
                            added to C2 construct as it would facilitate the quantification of fusion protein expression
                            and would help detecting the degree of success of post-hoc functionalization process.

                <p>
                    cellulose, so usage of dCBD yields more benefit when used in conjunction with BC. Also, BC
                    production is not directly dependent on trees. The cellulose microfibrils of BC are significantly
                    smaller than those of plant cellulose, making BC much more porous. Thus, post-hoc functionalization
                    is more effective for BC than plant cellulose. BC-producing bacteria produce cellulose as pellicles
                    which, when still wet, can easily be disintegrated into loose nanofibrils. However, one cannot
                    produce nanofibrils from phytocellulose without a cumbersome homogenization process.

                    get a sheet if a stress is applied to those while drying.

                    Since the chemical composition of BC is similar to phytocellulose, it can also be carboxymethylated,
                    acetylated, phosphorylated, and modified by other graft copolymerization and crosslinking reaction
                    to obtain a series of BC derivatives. The introduction of new functional groups to the BC structure
                    can endow BC with superior mechanical properties or/and stability against ready microbial

                <p>
                    As discussed earlier, modularity is our key to building a plug-n-play bioremediation platform. It is
                    an indispensable aspect of synthetic biology as well. We have incorporated the SpyTag/SpyCatcher
                    technology, also termed "molecular superglue", in our design of the fusion proteins (i.e. C1 and C2)
                    in order to ensure modularity. This is a technology for irreversible conjugation of recombinant
                    proteins. The peptide SpyTag spontaneously reacts, both autocatalytically and quantitatively, with
                    the protein SpyCatcher to form an intermolecular isopeptide bond (a covalent bond) between the pair.
                    We have used SpyTag002/SpyCatcher002 instead of the original SpyTag001/SpyCatcher001, as the former
                    is a second-generation, faster-reacting version of this protein superglue at cellular expression
                    levels. We have not used the latest SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003 system because it already exists in the
                    iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Thus, we intend to submit this codon optimized
                    SpyTag002/SpyCatcher002 system in the iGEM Registry as a contribution from our side to the synthetic
                    biology community.

                <p>
                    Proteins to bind or degrade a limitless range of contaminants can be bound to cellulose membranes.
                    In that sense, our filtration platform is inherently modular, thanks to SpyTag002/SpyCatcher002
                    system. If some future group of workers intend to construct a filter to address some pollution other
                    than organophosphate pollution, they would have to replace the OpdA part of C2 with their enzyme of
                    interest. This modified construct would still be compatible with C1 designed by us. That modified C2
                    and original C1 would together constitute a system to neutralize that other pollution. We
                    specifically encourage the future iGEM teams interested in bioremediation to adopt this strategy and
                    to add to this novel plug-n-play toolbox through their invaluable efforts as well as boundless

                    Down the road, we seek to build a functional, cost-effective, reliable filtration device which can
                    be installed in the regions where waterbodies are plagued with organophosphate pollution. A
                    functional hardware, in the context of our project is a filter coated with functionalized bacterial
                    cellulose (BC) sheet. At first our aim was to simply replicate a commonly found commercial electric
                    filter with candle. But it was soon realised that the residence time of water in such a candle would
                    be too less. In simple terms, the time spent by the large amount of input water would be too less
                    for the enzymes to act appreciably. Hence, we decided to implement a novel strategy; we decided to
                    coat the inner surface of a microchannel with BC. The advantage of microchannel is very large
                    surface area to volume. Almost all the (tiny amount of) water passing through the channel will be
                    acted upon by the enzymes. Also we can easily increase length of the channel for longer action of
                    enzymes. We will depend on principles of hydrodynamics and microfluidics to come up with
                    microchannels of specific shape(s) that ensure adequate residence time of OP molecules inside the
                    channel, so that the OpdA molecules get sufficient time to act upon those. In practice we decided to
                    coat microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) sheet. It would then serve as the proof of concept for a
                    microchannel whose bore has been coated with the functionalized BC filter we seek to develop. Using
                    microchannel solves the 'residence time' problem but introduced a host of technical challenges. The
                    MCC preparation needed to be compatible such that it can be easily coated. In that effort, we tried
                    varying different of parameters like different solvents, concentration of cellulose, drying time,
                    etc. Another challenge is the coating of the MCC sheet on the channel.

                    There are various methods of coating a fluid on a substrate, three of which seemed fit for our
                    project, namely, dip coating and electrospinning and drop casting. Electrospinning involves spraying
                    electrically charged fluid on a grounded plate. The charging of liquid is done via passing the
                    liquid through a high voltage syringe. This method was discarded since the solvent used by us did
                    not have appropriate electrical properties such as dielectric constant and viscosity. Dip coating
                    involves dipping the substrate in the solvent. That would be wasteful since it would coat the sheet
                    on both sides while water is passed on only one side. So finally we settled with drop casting in
                    which we poured our prepared solution on one side of the channel.

                <p>
                    We decided to drop cast our optimised solution MCC+DMSO+PVA on microchannel of square cross section
                    whose top is exposed to test our predictions. Probing can be done using fluorescent beads or UV-vis

                <p>
                    However, we anticipated many challenges with this design. First, only the bottom face has the
                    functionalised MCC coating due to which we may need very long time for layer of water near the top
                    to be purified. It will essentially be limited by diffusion of organophosphates from top to the
                    bottom since flow of fluid in any microchannel is essentially laminar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, we replaced the microchannels with tubes made up of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) whose diameter
                    is in the order of millimetres. These are readily available, cheap, inert, non-toxic, and
                    non-flammable. Low elastic modulus of PDMS enables these pipes to be flexible which can have a
                    fantastic consequence. It will induce turbulence in the passing water (no more  'boring ' laminar
                    flow). This can cause nice mixing of water and no longer we have to rely on diffusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, for the design of our hardware we propose the following. First, we make the filter
                     'candle '. We plan to make millimetre radius channels of PDMS. We plan to make the channels
                    cylindrical. Since a cylinder has no open side, we cannot employ drop casting. What we plan to do is
                    exploit capillary action. We dip just the top of one end in our cellulose solution and close the
                    other end, then the solution will rise. Then we can open the closed end after some time. This will
                    lead to the solution in the cylinder to fall, leaving a thin layer of coating. Before that we need
                    to adjust the adhesiveness (hydrophilicity) of the PDMS surface. This preparation is repeated for
                    large number (~1000) of tubes. Once all the coated cylinders are created, we bunch them into a
                    cylinder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming to the filtering action we can take the route of conventional water filters. We need water
                    moving into the cylinders at appreciable speed. For that we use a water pump through which we pass
                    the agricultural runoff. The speed of water from the pump will be sufficient to cause vibration and
                    turbulence which will lead to effective mixing of water. The pump pressure needs to be optimised.
                    This method has some possible disadvantages; the pump pressure could randomly spike which can lead
                    to damage of the channels. The pumps are available in only limited number of pressure values,
                    optimisation may not be feasible. The residence also could be too low if velocity is very high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, we propose again a novel strategy based on our previous experience which we describe as
                    follows: We accumulate the agricultural runoff in a tank. Then again, we use the capillary trick. We
                    dip the cylindrical bunch in the tank closing the other end. We plan to attach a frequency generator
                    at the other end for inducing turbulence. All the impure water enter through capilliary action.
                    There are two advantages of using the capilliary trick. We can keep a given volume of water in the
                    filter cavity as long as we want. We do not need to worry about residence time unless it is
                    prohibitively large. The other advantage is it uses very less power compared to conventional
                    electric filter which uses pump. Damage of channels is also minimised. Only power is used in low
                    frequency generator and moving up and down of the cylinder at regular intervals. This way we can
                    power it using batteries and aim to make it completely portable. However, it might be less practical
                    as very less amount of run off will be purified in one cycle. In that case, we would have to resort
                    to pump, or maybe think of something which has advantages of both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we are ready with the prototype of our Open-source Hardware (OSH), we intend to proceed for its
                    licensing and release into the SynBio community. So, we have lot more work to do, many more models
                    to build and many more experiments to do to get CellOPHane out there.
