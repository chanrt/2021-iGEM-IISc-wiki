                    For the functionalization aspect of our project, we have two constructs - C1 (SpyCatcher002-dCBD)
                    and C2 (OpdA-SpyTag002). This section mentions our efforts in order to produce, purify and
                    characterize these fusion proteins. We first cloned these modules in a suitable vector, carried out
                    some expression tests where we standardized the induction conditions, and then performed some
                    solubility tests as well, in order to check if these novel fusion proteins could be purified. We
                    were successful in figuring out suitable conditions for expression and purification of one of our
                    constructs, while it currently is a work-in-progress for the other construct.

                    Constructs C1 (SpyCatcher002-dCBD) and C2 (OpdA-SpyTag002) were synthesized by GenScript and shipped
                    to
                    us after being cloned into pUC57-Kan vectors. We amplified the constructs using suitable primers in
                    order to carry out Gibson assembly, by performing PCR with KOD polymerase. Gel electrophoresis
                    results
                    are given below:

                    In order to express our constructs in <em></em>E. coli</em>, we chose a pETMCN-T7 (KanR) vector,
                    because it has a
                    high
                    copy number and transcription using the T7 RNA polymerase can be strongly induced upon addition of
                    IPTG.
                </p>
                <p>
                    pETMCN-T7 was linearized by digestion with NdeI. PCR primers for amplification of C1 and C2 were
                    designed to have overlaps with pETMCN-T7 on either side of the NdeI site. Both the PCR amplified
                    constructs and the linearized vector were gel extracted. Gibson Assembly was performed on these

                    Amounts of protein loaded were not normalized, and hence large blobs were observed in the pellet
                    fractions. The bead-bound fraction for C1 showed a large band at ~25kDa, which implied that C1 was
                    appreciably soluble. No such observation could be made for C2.

                    was indeed soluble. To verify the same for C2, two Western blots were performed on the C2 pulldown

                    In the anti-GFP blot, a prominent band at ~75kDa could be observed, but there were a lot of other
                    bands
                    too, and similar lower molecular weight bands were observed for the anti-His blot too. This
                    suggested
                    that there was a lot of non-specific antibody binding, contamination, or protein degradation in case
                    of
                    C2. This was repeated for more dilute antibody treatments, but results looked similar, which led us
                    to
                    believe that C2 was indeed getting degraded.

                    The pulldown of C2 was performed again with an anti-GFP nanobody coupled to GST tagged

                    that pulldown was unsuccessful. We suspected that C2 might not be properly soluble and hence might
                    not
                    have been interacting with the anti-GFP nanobody tagged beads. We thus decided to modify the C2

                    in

                    C2(2.0).
                    We suspected that the hydrophobic signal peptide attached to OpdA might be leading to aggregation,

                    Coumaphos. We also decided to grow the bacteria in both LB and Terrific Broth (TB), because a short
                    literature review showed that some people have used TB as the growth medium for the secondary
                    culture for the OpdA production

                    The normalized absorbances of the degradation product can be considered as a measure for enzyme
                    activity in the crude cell extract. As can be observed from the graph, when grown in LB, the enzyme
                    activity seemed to decrease from the Empty Vector control to C2 to C2 (2.0). However, when grown in
                    Terrific Broth (TB), while there is almost no change in enzyme activity between C2 and Empty Vector
                    control, there is a huge increase in enzymatic activity in case of C2 (2.0).

                    in
                    this regard, they are not exhaustive and are often ambiguous. Based on literature review, we
                    decided
                    to focus on DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), NMP (N-methyl pyrrolidinone and a solution of 7% LiCl in

                    To test whether it was possible to form a mechanically strong film of bacterial cellulose from
                    the
                    solutions in these solvents, we decided to perform a standard test used by materials engineers
                    for
                    understanding this - drop casting. This small scale test saves wastage of resources by doing a
                    random hit-and-trial with huge volumes of samples. A drop of the sample is spread out over a
                    glass
                    slide and heated at a temperature about 20 oC below its boiling point, and then subjected to a
                    variety of treatment conditions. The film formed on the glass slide is observed.

                    Drop-castings were performed with different sample volumes. Since MCC was most soluble in DMSO
                    among
                    the three solvents, we decided to investigate the influence of different heating durations on

                    Next, we sought to see if the addition of a binder like PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) could influence
                    the
                    mechanical integrity of the film and strengthen it. We tried to carry out drop-castings using
                    the
                    same solutions, but with 10 % w/v PVA added to it. Since quenching gave better results
                    previously,
                    all the samples were quenched on a pool of acetone after heating to evaporate the solvent.
                    Temperatures for heating were same as before. However, we found that all the drop-casted films
                    were
                    patchy and flaky and had turned brownish, except for the solution containing DMSO as solvent,
                    which
                    formed a homogenous sheet, albeit with a brownish hue.

                    Having been slightly surprised at these results, we were intrigued to find out the possible
                    cause(s)
                    behind this. PVA is known to be strongly preferring the formation of mechanically strong films.
                    The
                    results therefore seem counter-intuitive at the first glance. However, a survey of existing
                    literature and the materials data sheets provided by companies led us to conclude that the
                    heating
                    regime used for most of the samples had exceeded the degradation temperature of PVA, while the
                    heating temperature for DMSO was slightly lower than the average degradation temperature. The
                    brownish colour was most likely imparted due to the influence of the degradation products of
                    PVA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We therefore decided to redo our experiment for PVA by using a lower temperature. Although this
                    would prolong the heating duration, we expected to see a stable film being formed, devoid of the
                    brownish hue of the previous case. Our hypothesis was indeed validated in the next experiment

                    We have thus tried to optimise the conditions for making MCC sheet from commercially available
                    powder. Further studies need to be done by drop-casting on a block of PDMS or inside a PDMS tube
                    instead of a glass slide. Detailed studies need to also be performed on the interesting solvent
                    system of 7% LiCl in DMAc, because the film formed in this case absorbs moisture due to the
                    presence
                    of hygroscopic LiCl and spontaneously gets healed of any cracks present.

                        For this purpose, the lambda red recombination cassette of pKD46(AmpR) was amplified using
                        gradient PCR and put under tetR promoter in pST-KT. We also planned to amplify the
                        complement1-FRT-CamR-FRT-complement2 fragment which would replace the part of the <em>celG</em>
                        sequence
                        we wished to remove. The complement1 and complement2 are DNA sequences that are complementary to

                        Hestrin-Schramm (HS) culture medium at 28&deg;C, as per the paper Keshk, S. M. A. S. (2006)

                    <p>
                        We first ordered an Agar slant of the ATCC 11142 strain of the bacteria from the National
                        Chemical
                        Laboratories in Pune.

                        As per the HS media preparation protocol of the 2020 UCSC iGEM Team, we prepared the HS medium
                        and
                        inoculated our bacteria into that. However, even after 3-4 days, no growth was observed, which
                        was
                        concerning given that the bacterium has a generation time of about 3 days.

                        store
                        the culture. This medium, unlike the HS medium, has no buffer components and has sorbitol
                        instead of
                        glucose as the carbon source. This medium, we hereafter refer to as the "Sorbitol medium".

                        Based on their suggestion and using the protocol provided in their paper (Adepu, S. 2020), we
                        changed the composition of the HS medium to have 3.4 g of Na2HPO4 instead of 2.7 g and pH 4.5
                        instead of 6. We then tried to grow our bacteria in this medium and we were successful!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, we inoculated two cultures, one in the HS medium and one in the Sorbitol medium. While
                        the
                        one in the Sorbitol medium got contaminated as shown by the rapid increase in OD<sub>600</sub>,
                        the
                        one in HS
                        medium grew at a slow and steady state, showing that Sorbitol medium is much
                        more prone to contamination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we now tried to follow their protocol to setup secondary cultures for bacterial
                        cellulose
                        production. But, even 2 weeks later, there were no changes observed in the secondary culture
                        (Figure
                        4).
