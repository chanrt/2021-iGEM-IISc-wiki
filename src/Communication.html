                <h2>Open Day 2020: SynBio Game, Agar Art and Collection of feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    The Open Day in IISc is the day when everyone is allowed inside the institute and all the different
                    departments setup exhibits or games related to science. The purpose behind this is to encourage
                    scientific temper among the general populace. 28th February is celebrated as National Science Day,
                    to monumentalise and commemorates the anniversary of the discovery of the Raman Effect which was
                    discovered by Sir C V Raman, a former director of our institute. On the occasion of National Science
                    Day (28th February) and Founder's Day (3rd March), the Institute opens its doors to the general
                    public showcasing the various scientific activities being pursued in our institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Open Day, our iGEM team setup a stall to popularise synthetic biology and communicate the science
                    behind our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the stall, we had an Agar Art exhibit, where we showed different drawings that can be made by
                    streaking bacteria onto the Agar plates. The original agar artist was Alexander Flemming! We found
                    Agar Art to be a powerful tool to communicate scientific concept of culturing microbes. One of the
                    objectives was to convey the importance of the being able to culture microbes. Being able to culture
                    microbes enables people to study them and gain better insights on the mode of functionality of the
                    organism. We were able to show that we can culture bacteria on fixed regions and bacterial
                    culturing, an essential microbiology skill, is also an opportunity to express your artistic
                    inclination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other stall setup by the iGEM team devised a game to communicate the concept of BioBricks to the
                    general public, particularly students. The objective was to convey that different parts are required
                    to make a composite object.

                    BioBricks are nothing but tiny components that can assembled together to generate a larger synthetic
                    biology circuit. By comparing BioBricks to components of commonly used composite objects such as a
                    Burger, we attempt to develop an intuitive understanding of BioBricks. As you can see from the above
                    list, we had common elements that can be used in the formation of more than one composite object.
                    The idea behind this was to emphasis the modularity of BioBricks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the participants completed generating as many blocks of words as they could in the given time,
                    they were rewarded with informational bookmarks in accordance to their performance. We also
                    explained the ideology behind the game and the connect to the concept of BioBricks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the third and the last exhibit put up by our team, we shared the ideas of the past iGEM Teams of
                    IISc and the project idea our team was currently working on this year. We established the premise of
                    our project by informing them about the menace caused by the problem the team hoped to tackle. We
                    proposed our solution to the problem and then encouraged the audience to share their opinions and
                    thoughts on our projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were enlightened about the looming fear around the idea of synthetically modified biological
                    products and organisms. We engaged in conversation with several visitors of our stalls attempting to
                    convey the marvels of synthetic biology while strongly emphasising on the various safety steps taken
                    while genetically engineering products or organisms. Many individuals were unaware of the use of
                    synthetic biology in the production of genetically modified crops, while others expressed their
                    concerns regarding GMO crops. We discussed the role played by genetically modified crops in helping
                    India becoming a self-sufficient country in terms of its agricultural demands and help reach its
                    current agricultural productivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In more than one way, the Open Day experience opened our eyes to the damage done, by smear campaigns
                    on GMOs, to the public opinion and interest in synthetic biology. As novice synthetic biologists, we
                    wanted to do our part in help disperse the irrational fears and unscientific misconceptions wrongly
                    associated with synthetic biology. The Open Day interactions motivated us to pursue further modes of
                    science communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, we collected feedback from all the people who came to our exhibits. We strongly believe
                    that science communication is just as much about hearing from the general public as it is about
                    talking about the science. The feedback we received helped us understand how far we were able to
                    succeed with respect to our efforts and enabled to better focus our ideas for future initiatives.
                    Some of the feedback we got are listed below:

                <h2>Synthetic Biology Symposium</h2>
                <p>
                    We organized a Synthetic Biology Symposium, named "SYNBYTE" on the 21st and 22nd of August 2021.
                    Among the speakers invited to speak at the symposium were synthetic biologists from all over the
                    globe:

                    Our objective behind organising this symposium was to bring the synthetic biology scientific
                    community to the general public and our fellow iGEMers. Through the means of the symposium, we
                    wanted the general public engage with synthetic biology and appreciate the versatility of synthetic
                    biology applications.

                    We took care to represent the voices and opinions of a diverse set of extremely talented and skilled
                    individuals in Synthetic Biology, from all over the world and from both academia and industry, to
                    understand and give other people the opportunity to hear about multiple perspective of synthetic
                    biology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professor Nagasuma Chandra in the inauguration talked about the importance of synthetic biology and
                    its role in addressing social challenges. In-silico biology hand in hand with synthetic biology can
                    trigger the next biological revolution. She emphasised on the role played iGEM in this revolution
                    and how iGEM enables the synthetic biology community to come together and deliver innovative
                    solutions tackling societal problems. She echoed our sentiments regarding the organisation of the
                    symposium wherein we hoped to communicate the foundations in the field of synthetic biology in a
                    holistic manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only did the various individuals share the story of their science with the audience but engaged
                    with members of academia in the audience regarding future research directions and engaged with the
                    general public regarding the practical translation of their science during the moderated question
                    and answer sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To conclude, the team summarised our takeaways from the symposium and expressed our eagerness to see
                    where the field of synthetic biology takes the world in the next few years.

                <h2>Rewiring Life: A Beginner's Guide (SynBio Primer) </h2>
                <p>
                    The members of the team wrote an illustrated book titled <b>Rewiring Life: A Beginners Guide</b>
                    introducing the field of synthetic biology so that it can be used to deliver various concepts in an
                    understandable and fun manner. Right from the introduction of synthetic biology to its different
                    applications, this book covers it all! The book is about 220 pages long and is current under review
                    by IISc Press. The book was intended for middle school and high school students right from 6th grade
                    to 12th grade.
                </p>
                <br>
                <b>Our Objective Behind Writing the Book:</b>
                <p>
                    Synthetic biology is a fast-growing, interdisciplinary field of biology that is concerned with the
                    design and creation of new biological parts, systems and pathways and the re-design of existing
                    natural biological systems for purposes useful to humankind. Rapid strides in this nascent field of
                    research over the past decade have broadened tremendously our perspectives of biology and are
                    heralding the next scientific revolution - be it the creation of living forms from simple
                    biomolecules or rewiring a cell's metabolic factory. Despite these rapid advances in synthetic
                    biology all over the globe, the field has been somewhat lacking pace in India. The number of
                    research labs actively working on this in our country is miniscule compared to that in other
                    countries like the US and China.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To further the nation's scientific progress and to ensure that we keep pace with the developments
                    around the world, India needs to train the next generation of scientists with the basic knowledge of
                    synthetic biology and inspire them to explore deeper into the subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this book, we intend to explain the basic principles of synthetic biology, starting right
                    from the fundamentals of genetic engineering and molecular biology and building up to the most
                    recent advances in the field. The book is dedicated to middle-school students, who are not
                    previously exposed to the fundamental conceptual basis of these areas. We have built all the basic
                    principles from scratch, and special focus has been given to keep the book as interactive as
                    possible. Illustrations, comic strips, snippets on various discoverers in these areas and lucid
                    explanations based on innumerable hand-picked examples are hallmarks of the book. We are unaware of
                    the publication of any such simple-yet-exhaustive book on SynBio dedicated to middle and high school
                    students till date, not just in India but all over the globe. We hope that this book will inspire at
                    least a few, if not many readers to explore the topics in greater detail and consider pursuing a
                    career in synthetic biology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no proper primer of synthetic biology or genetic engineering available in the market. The
                    only general books on the subject (i.e., not including research monographs) are dedicated to
                    advanced undergraduates or post-graduates. This book differs from all of them in lucidly yet
                    exhaustively conveying the fundamental concepts needed for the subject, finally attaining a climax
                    in the discussion on the recent advances of synthetic biology. This book is unique in the fact that
                    it is a standalone book and assumes no prerequisite knowledge on the part of the reader, except
                    basic biological theories like the cell doctrine.

                    Apart from our primer, we also prepared a short audiobook wherein we hoped to communicate the
                    relevance of our project to the global community without getting into too many technical details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We realised while working on a synthetic biology primer that through the primer we hoped to
                    communicate concepts, but we still hadn't addressed why we choose this problem and how it affect so
                    many people across the country.

                <p>
                    The script of the audiobook is attached below. To summarise the storyline, the protagonist is a
                    student and the son of a farmer, he and several other students suffer from organophosphate poisoning
                    due to runoff water from the agricultural fields polluting their water source. After highlighting
                    the problem, we proceed to propose our plan to tackle organophosphate pollution and how today the
                    problem we are addressing is that of organophosphate but tomorrow with minimal modifications, our
                    system can be adapted for another pollutant.

                <h2>Talk to a Scientist</h2>
                <p>
                    Talk To A Scientist is a weekly webinar series organized for children aged 6-16 years. In every
                    webinar of these series, a scientist is invited to tell the children about some topic or concept in
                    science. Talk to A Scientist is funded by the first ever IndiaBioscience Outreach grant and is an
                    one of kind programme for science outreach and education in India. Started amidst the pandemic by Dr
                    Karishma and Kaushik and Snehal Kadam, we believed that TTAS was the best platform to reach a
                    diverse population of the young minds of India and engage in conversation with them about the
                    wonders of synthetic biology. We reached out to the TTAS Team and they were kind enough to host for
                    an hour interactive talk as part of their ongoing season. We were thrilled about this opportunity
                    and prepared a set of slides in accordance to the format suggested by the TTAS organisers.

                    The session titled "Talk To A Biologist About Synthetic Biology" happened on 28th August 2021. In
                    the session we covered the following topics
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The idea of what is life based on PICERAS and the comparison of living organisms to engineered
                        products.</li>
                    <li>The design principle behind life and how they can be used in synthetic biology.</li>
                    <li>Construction of cells from basic biomolecules.</li>
                    <li>Designing Cells to Obtained Desired Products.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    The questions we wanted the young minds to think about were:-
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Can scientists design life and make customized living organisms to solve global problems?</li>
                    <li>Can a cell be constructed from scratch using just basic biomolecules?</li>
                    <li>How can you design cells to make them produce what you want?</li>
                    <li>Is a living organism different from an engineered product, like say a radio?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We conclude the session by talking about our iGEM project. The problem caused by the rampant usage
                    of organophosphates and how we propose to tackle this problem. The young minds who attend the
                    session seem to have greatly enjoyed the session. Their questions amazed us and their infectious
                    excitement for our project greatly invigorated us.

                    We prepared slides to introduce synthetic biology to school children between the age of 6-12 years
                    and have made them publicly available. These slides were design with the ideology of being able to
                    introduce synthetic biology to school children. We are currently awaiting feedback from various
                    users.

                <h2>Project promotion video in multiple languages</h2>
                <p>
                    As part of the required iGEM deliverables, we created a short video to promote our project. Our
                    motivation to record the project promotion videos in different languages arose from a phone call one
                    of our team members made to their family back home. We realised the importance in communicating our
                    science in the native languages of the beneficiary of our projects. About half of India's population
                    relies on agriculture and many million people use pesticides. In order to truly communicate how our
                    team plans to tackle the menace caused by organophosphate pesticide usage, we realised the necessity
                    for us to produce linguistic diverse content. Besides English, the video was recorded in 6 different
                    Indian languages - Hindi, Odia, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, along with the subtitles for all
                    these videos. This was to help our project reach the different corners of our country, India, known
                    for its huge linguistic diversity. According to the 2011 Census of India, 43.63% of our country's
                    population are native speakers of Hindi. The language with the next greatest number of native
                    speakers was Bengali, 8.03% of our country. We were attempting to record our project promotion video
                    in the 10 languages with the highest proportion of native speakers. We especially wanted to record
                    the video in Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and Odiya in order to reach as many people as possible. Other
                    language native speakers also are fluent in Hindi or Bengali or English. Kannada holds an especially
                    important place owing to our institution being present in the state of Karnataka where the local
                    language is Kannada. The other languages with high proportion of native speakers were Marathi,
                    Telugu, Gujarati and Urdu. We were unfortunately not able to find translators located on campus to
                    help us record the video in these regional languages within the deadline due to remote classes and
                    work being preferred and suggested as much as possible, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been
                    working on getting our science translated into these languages. Additionally we are also trying to
                    record the project promotion video in Assamese and Kokborok, the main native languages of the
                    Assamese and Tripuri people respectively. We conservatively estimate based on the 7 languages we
                    have recorded our promotion video in, we are able to reach about 80% of the Indian Population.

                <h2>An Interview with IISc Connect</h2>
                <p>
                    IISc Connect, the quarterly magazine of the Indian Institute of Science, interviewed our iGEM team.
                    This interview was conducted by Sangeetha Devi Kumar. The magazine is an initiative of the Office of
                    Communications of IISc where they hope to share stories of members, their science and the rich
                    heritage of the IISc community with the outside world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was an tremendously important opportunity to communicate and receive inputs from various
                    members of the academic community in IISc about our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The points discussed in our interview are listed below:

                <p>
                    The first wave of the pandemic was experienced by members of our team off-campus. We didn't have
                    access to labs to start our work. We sought special permission to return back to campus in order to
                    start working in the lab in March 2021. However, the institute shut down all departments within a
                    month due to the second wave of the pandemic and high number of cases. We lost access to labs. We
                    had to live on campus through the second wave away from our families during this very turbulent
                    time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project timeline was greatly delayed. We weren't even able to order reagents or primers we
                    needed to start off with experiments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Honestly as researchers, we hardly had any wet lab experience and faced a very steep learning curve
                    in the laboratory.

                    We were interviewed by Rosemary from Gen Script as a part of their sponsorship contest. Apart from
                    it being a part of their contest, it was a wonderful opportunity for us to present our goals and the

                        fertilisers
                        leads to runoff water based contamination of water source. This causes several determinantal
                        effects
                        on human health and environment and can't be degraded by the living organisms.(Connect to SC
