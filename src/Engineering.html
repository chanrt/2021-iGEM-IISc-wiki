                    In this page, we will introduce the Engineering Design Cycle that we followed in order to eventually
                    accomplish our short-term goals. We followed this workflow for all four components that constitute
                    CellOPHane: protein production, bacterial cellulose (BC) production, MCC sheet production, and
                    hardware development. During this process, successful results were obtained, but also new challenges
                    were discovered. Nevertheless, the drawbacks forced us to come up with new ideas and initiated new
                    cycles of engineering, ultimately driving our project forward. While the exact experiments and
                    results are described on the Results page, here we outline the underlying thought process that led
                    to our final engineering success.

                    Synthetic biology is a discipline of science that differs a lot from the others. Usually, one would
                    use the scientific method to obtain results in the majority of life sciences, centering one 's work
                    on making observations and performing experiments. However, SynBio goes beyond that! It is all about
                    constructing something new from parts (biological parts if you may). That is why, sometimes the
                    engineering design process fits better with these projects, since a product has to be built or a
                    "genetically engineered machine" has to perform a specific task. It reminds us that iGEM stands for
                    International Genetically Engineered Machines.

                                After long search through literature, we selected dCBD and OpdA. The former was selected
                                for its strong, synergistic binding with microcrystalline cellulose. The latter was
                                selected for its broad substrate range that includes a couple of extremely hazardous
                                pesticides which are heavily used in Indian agricultural fields. We chose sfGFP as the
                                perfect reporter for our purpose.

                                Initially we tried to incorporate SpyDock in fusion protein C1 and SpyTag002 in fusion
                                protein C2. Maintaining modularity was our first and foremost priority while designing
                                the filter platform, and we planned to utilize noncovalent interaction in binding C1
                                with C2. SpyDock is a modified version of SpyCatcher which binds in 1:1 stoichiometry
                                with SpyTag002 via noncovalent interaction, and not irreversible isopeptide linkage.
                                SpyTag/SpyDock system is at the heart of Spy&Go resin that is used for protein
                                purification. We planned to functionalize the bacterial cellulose (BC) sheet by
                                incubating it with cocktail of C1 (SpyDock-dCBD) and C2 (OpdA-SpyTag002-sfGFP). After
                                the functionalized filter gets installed (as a part of the associated hardware), the BC
                                base of the filter would eventually get worn out with time. Thereafter, we can just flow
                                2.5M imidazole solution through our filter. It would elute out the C2 molecules from the
                                filter, which can be purified and reused later. Thus, adopting this strategy would
                                enable one of our two fusion proteins to be reusable. Most importantly, C2 being larger
                                than C1 we hoped that this strategy would make our filtration process more economically
                                viable.

                                Before stepping into wet lab work, we designed a first-order mathematical model on
                                SpyTag/SpyDock interaction. We searched for parametric values required to run this model
                                and fed those to it.

                                Upon running computer simulations, the model yielded plots regarding the extent of
                                SpyTag/SpyDock complex dissociation at various volumetric flow rates.

                                The model showed that SpyTag/SpyDock interaction gets abolished after a short period of
                                time and, as a result, the process of C2 getting washed away has a very low lifetime.
                                Though we hoped that the noncovalent interaction-based strategy would decrease the cost
                                as well as would make C2 reusable, we learnt from the model this strategy would take us
                                nowhere. Thus, the model safely ruled out the incorporation of SpyTag/SpyDock into the
                                constructs we would design next.

                                The previous cycle made our focus shift to covalent protein ligation strategies instead.
                                The SpyTag/SpyCatcher system readily attracted our attention. The interaction between
                                the two is covalent, which means the binding is essentially irreversible. The reaction
                                requires only mixing and is rapid, high yielding, robust to experimental conditions, and
                                shows very good specificity. The system is functional over a wide range of temperature,
                                pH and salinity. SpyTag002 and SpyCatcher002 were the preferred versions. We planned to
                                incorporate SpyCatcher002 in fusion protein C1 and SpyTag002 in fusion protein C2. We
                                also thought of some back-up plans. We included KpnI restriction sites on either end of
                                the sfGFP CDS, should the need of removing sfGFP ever arises.

                                We designed two constructs  - C1 (SpyCatcher002-dCBD) and C2 (OpdA-SpyTag002-sfGFP). To
                                know the efficiency of our system, both C1 and C2 proteins had to be synthesized, which
                                was carried out using  <em></em>E. coli</em> DH5 alpha as the cloning host and  <em>E. coli</em> BL21(DE3) as the
                                expression host. The specific genes for dCBD, OpdA, and sfGFP were derived from <em>T.
                                    reesei, A. radiobacter, and A. victoria</em> respectively. We codon optimized the
                                genes for
                                expression in  <em>E. coli</em> with SnapGene 's codon optimizing tool. pETMCN-T7 (KanR) was the
                                vector we intended to use in our experiments and it included features (e.g. T7 promoter,
                                lac operator, and ribosomal binding site) that allowed for the inducible gene
                                expression. Additionally, both constructs have a 10x-His tag for subsequent protein
                                purification. We ordered the DNA sequences of both C1 and C2 from GenScript. They were
                                shipped to us after being cloned into pUC57-Kan vectors.

                                were subsequently transformed into  <em>E. coli</em> DH5 alpha. Inoculation into liquid culture

                                Thus, we performed a western blot using anti-His primary antibody. The results showed
                                prominent bands at ~25 kDa for C1 and at ~75 kDa for C2. It helped us to finalize the
                                optimal induction conditions (namely 0.5 mM IPTG at 30&deg;C) as well.

                                To perform solubility test, first we followed these conditions to induce a large scale
                                 <em>E. coli</em> BL21(DE3) cultures. Then, harvested cells were lysed and subjected to pulldown
                                with Ni-NTA. SDS-PAGE was performed on the boiled samples taken from different culture
                                fractions (viz., lysate, pellet, supernatant, washed and bead-bound). Bead-bound
                                fraction for C1 showed prominent band at (~25 kDa), but C2 did not. Next, we performed
                                two Western blots on the C2 pulldown samples, one using anti-His primary antibody and
                                the other using anti-GFP primary antibody. Later, the pulldown of C2 was performed with
                                an anti-GFP nanobody coupled to GST-tagged glutathione-sepharose beads and it was
                                followed by SDS-PAGE.

                                is soluble. C2 might not have been soluble.

                                The lack of solubility of C2 possibly stems from undesired protein-protein interaction.
                                Therefore, we decided to make C2 less bulky by clipping out the sfGFP module. As

                                The amplification of lambda Red recombinase system was successful, but that of
                                complement1-FRT-CamR-FRT-complement2 was not. Based on the gel electrophoresis imaging,
                                formation of primer dimer (PD) was probably the reason the latter failed. PD is a
                                potential by-product in PCR reaction where two primer molecules hybridize to each other
                                because of strings of complementary bases in them. The DNA polymerase amplifies the PD,
                                leading to competition for PCR reagents, thus potentially inhibiting amplification of
                                the DNA sequence targeted for PCR amplification.

                                in the cultures being very old.

                                As a back-up plan, we also tried to make a sheet of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)
                                from the commercially available powdered form. Though it is not directly synthesized by
                                bacteria, such a sheet would help us with accomplishing our Proof of Concept goals. MCC
                                and BC are almost similar in their characteristics.

                                In general, quenching gave better results compared to annealing. Drops derived from
                                MCC+DMSO solution yielded a cracked surface upon quenching. Drops derived from MCC+NMP
                                solution gave an excessively flaky residue. Sheet derived from MCC+LiCl/DMAc solution
                                showed negligible presence of cracks, but it adsorbed moisture after it had returned to
                                room temperature. The BC sheet we desire to make cannot be flaky. Thus, MCC+NMP solution
                                was not subjected to further investigation.

                                exceeded the degradation temperature of PVA. It was the degradation of PVA that had
                                caused the charred appearance of the films.

                                As the first step towards building a functional hardware as the implementation of our
                                novel strategy, we decided to coat the inner surface of a microchannel with MCC. It
                                would then serve as the proof of concept for a microchannel whose bore has been coated
                                with the functionalized bacterial cellulose (BC) filter we seek to develop. Important
                                aspects of this are the thickness of MCC coating, extent of uniformity in coat thickness
                                along the length of microchannel, durability of the coating etc.

                                We first planned to fabricate a microchannel of square cross section whose one side is
                                open. The Then, we can pour MCC+DMSO+PVA solution (suits our purpose, as determined by
                                our work on MCC sheet development) on it through the open face. Upon drying, we would
                                get a MCC coating on one of the faces. Lastly, a glass slab is to be used to seal the
                                open face. As glass is transparent, it would help us in probing into the flow
                                characteristics inside the microchannel by using fluorescent beads in future.

                                However, we anticipated many challenges with this design. First, only one of the faces
                                ultimately happens to have the MCC coating. This means that in the prototype we seek to
                                develop with functionalized BC sheet in place of MCC layer, only one side of the
                                microchannel would host the embedded proteins. Thus, filtration efficiency of the system
                                would decrease as most of the organophosphate molecules simply pass through the
                                microchannel without coming into contact with a protein molecule for even once. Second,
                                fabricating a microchannel in the clean room at requires special expertise and
                                prohibitive amount of resources, given the scarcity of time.

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Thus, we changed our plan. We wanted some simpler system as our Proof of Concept. We
                                chose the tubes made up of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) whose diameter is in the order of
                                millimetres. These are readily available, cheap, inert, non-toxic, and non-flammable.
                                Being transparent, rheological studies would be quite easy to perform. Since PDMS is
                                almost always cured with some cross-linking agent, it shows time-dependent elastic
                                deformation. Low elastic modulus of PDMS enables these pipes to be flexible (this
                                property might be valuable while designing a working prototype of our project). We tried
                                to coat such pipes on the inner side with MCC.

                                We collected MCC+DMSO+PVA solution (as described previously) in a syringe and injected
                                that into a 10 cm long PDMS tube of about 5 mm inner diameter. The pipe was left to dry
                                in an orientation horizontal relative to ground.

                                Even after 48 hours, the solution inside pipe did not dry off. Neither did it settle on
                                the PDMS surface. It happened most probably because the PDMS surface is very
                                hydrophobic, whether MCC+DMSO+PVA solution is less so.
